<H1>VMS Help server Bugs</H1>
This is a list of known bugs and desired improvements. Don't let it shrink too
fast : send your bug reports and suggestions to

<LI>The keyword search works fine on any number of levels down, but then the
generic daemon doesn't know how deep the server went, so anchor names lack the
intermediate levels. Solution : generate anchor names relative to the input path
(before '?').
<LI>DANGER : Attempts to access VMS topics with a weird name like ":=" will
crash the server because VMS will try to create a .HLP file with an invalid file
specification due to these special characters. Solution : Make a good escaping
system (that works with VMS and Un*x styles as well). Crude and bulletproof
solution : Ignore any offending topic name !
<LI>Reference to another help library through @ will only search SYS$HELP
for the corresponding .HLB file.
<LI>We need an overview page that lists all help libraries available.
