<H1>Strings</H1>The purpose of a string is to allow any sequence of printable characters
and the space to be transmitted. A string is a sequence of ASCII characters,
written using C's notation for strings. Thus, a string is surrounded
by double-quote characters and excludes control characters. <P>
If a double-quote character is used inside a string, it must appear
as the sequence \" (backslash followed by double quote). <P>
A control character can be represented by a backslash followed by
its ASCII sequence number in octal notation.<P>
The NUL is not representable.<P>
