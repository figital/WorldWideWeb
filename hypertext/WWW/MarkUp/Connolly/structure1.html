<TITLE>HTML tests: ISINDEX</TITLE>
<NEXTID ID=id1>
<ISINDEX>
<H1>searchable document</H1>

This test is part of <A NAME=id1 HREF="complete.html">the complete
HTML usage</A> reference. It has to be a separate document because
it's an example of document structure.<P>

It contains a NEXTID element mostly for grins.<P>
