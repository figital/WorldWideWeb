<TITLE>HyperText Markup: Errors</TITLE>
<NEXTID ID=id2>
It is an error to start the body of an HTML document with data.

<H1>Error: Data not allowed at this point in BODY element</H1>
This test is part of <A NAME=id1 HREF="complete.html">the complete
HTML usage</A> reference. It has to be a separate document because
it's an example of document structure.<P>
