<H1><A NAME=top>HTML Writing Guidelines</A></H1>

These are things to watch out for to make sure your
data can be parsed by standard implementations.

<H2>Text Elements</H2>

nesting errors<P>

<H3>Names</H3>

34 character max.<P>

<H2>Normal Text Content</H2>

Use entities for all &lt;, &gt; and &amp; characters.

@@@ Latin 1 characters?

comment: <!-- foo I'm a comment!--> The sample implementation
groks. For copyrights, RCS keywords, etc.<P>

processing instruction: <?bold lkjsdf > If you've _got_ to
stick TeX macros or something in there, use this. The sample
implementation won't even tell you it's there, though.<P>

<H2>Literal Text Content</H2>

Try to use as few entities as possible in Literal mode: only
treat '&lt;' followed by '/', &amp; followed by a letter or '#',
and &gt; when it follows ]] as entites. Old-style clients
will display markup in an RCDATA section as data.

<XMP>
<!-- this would be a comment in PCDATA. It's data in RCDATA. -->

<! this would be an markup delcaration, which would be an
error in PCDATA. It's data in RCDATA.>

<start> tags are fine!
& as long as it's not followed by a letter or '#', it's fine!
&# is even ok, unless it's followed by a letter or a number.
</XMP>

<H2>Other Elements</H2>

<H3>TITLE</H3>

Keep the title short and free of &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; characters.
No newlines.

<H2>Anchors</H2>

Thou shalt quote thy URLs. Use NAMEs that start with a letter.
Remember: 34 chars max.
