<TITLE>HyperText Markup: Recommended Usage</TITLE>

<H1>Recommended HTML Usage</H1>

This part of <A HREF="file:spec.html">the HTML specification</A>
 discusses recommended usage. These constructs should work even on
pretty broken implementations. <P>

<H2>Structure of an HTML document</H2>

An HTML document should start with a <A NAME=id1 HREF="#TITLE">TITLE
element</A>.

<H2>Elements of the Body</H2>

Most text elements consist of a start tag, some content, and an end
tag.<P>

Some elements are "empty" and consist of only a start tag. For
example, paragraphs are separated by the P element, which is
just a P tag.
<P>

Six levels of headings are supported: <P>

<H3>Level three heading</H3>

<H4>Level four heading</H4>

<H5>five</H5>

<H6>six</H6>

Unordered lists: <P>

<UL><LI>This is the first item of an unordered list.

<LI>This is the
second item. It's kinda long, and should wrap around on most screens.

<LI>This is the third item. It's only one paragraph, but it's got a
paragraph tag at the end.

<LI>This is the fourth and final item.
</UL>
Ordered lists:<P>

<OL><LI>This is the first item of an unordered list. 

<LI>This is the second item. It's kinda long, and should wrap around
on most screens.

<LI>This is the third item -- you know, the one with the P element.

<LI>This is the fourth and final item.
</OL>

<DL><DT>term <DD> definition 
<DT>another term <DD> and its definition
</DL>

The address element indicates the author or source of the document. <P>

<ADDRESS>DWC
connolly@convex.com</ADDRESS>

<H2>Other Elements</H2>

<H3><A NAME=TITLE>TITLE</A></H3>

The TITLE element names the document. The content of the TITLE element
is raw character data. It should be less than 72 characters, and it
should contain no linebreaks, '&lt;', '>', or '&amp;' characters. <P>

<H3>ISINDEX</H3>

Indicates the document is searchable.<P>

<H2>Anchors</H2>

A span of text can be marked as an anchor, for example:<P>
<A NAME="Fred">Fred Flinstone</A><P>

Click <A HREF="neighbor">here</A> to view a neighbor
document.<P>

<H2>Tags</H2>

A start tag is a name surrouded by angle brackets. An end tag has a
slash before the name.<P>

<H3>Names</H3>

A name should be a letter followed by letter and/or numbers. Case is
not significant.<P>

<H2>Normal Text Content</H2>

Normal text  in HTML is parsed for markup. The characters '&lt;', '>',
and '&amp;' should be treated as <A HREF="#special">special
characters</A>, lest they be interpreted as markup.<P>

Lines should not exceed 72 characters. Line breaks have no
significance except to separate words.<P>

<H2>Literal Text Content</H2>

Sections of literal text are represented in HTML as replaceable
character data, RCDATA. Most markup is ignored in RCDATA.<P>

Line breaks are significant, and characters are rendered in a
fixed-width font to preserve horizontal formatting. <P>
<XMP>This is literal text. THIS word
should line up under  THIS word.

There should be exactly three blank lines between here



and here.
 </XMP>

The characters '&amp;', '&lt;', and '>' should be treated as a <A
HREF="#special">special characters</A>.<P>

<XMP>SGML tags look like <start> and &lt;/end>.
The marked section close delimiter looks like ]]&gt;.
But ]] is just two close square brackets, and
> is just a greater-than sign.</XMP>

<H2><A NAME="special">Special Characters</A>
</H2>

Characters that are used for markup can be represented by entity
references. Entity references are written:<P>
<XMP>&amp;name;</XMP>

The following special characters are used in HTML<P>

<DL><DT>&lt;<DD>lt
<DT>&gt;<DD>gt
<DT>&amp;<DD>amp
<DT>"<DD>quot
<DT>'<DD>apos
</DL>
 <P>
