<TITLE>HyperText Markup: Writing Mistakes</TITLE>

<H1>Tolerating broken HTML writers</H1>

These are illegal according to SGML, but they're so prevalent that
they're supported by the sample implementation. <P>

Please stop generating HTML in this style! <P>

<H2><A NAME=NeXT>NeXT editor</A></H2>

<H3>broken in Linemode Browser 1.3c</H3>
Looks for name in end tag before determining whether to end an RCDATA
section:<P>

<XMP>
This example section ends here: </foo .

Even though the above ETAGO begins a markup error,
this text is in a normal paragraph in conforming implementations.<P>

But, alas, it's not on the linemode browser.<P>

The following XMP tag is an error on conforming systems:
</XMP>

<A NAME=10>This</A> anchor's name starts with a digit, which is not a
name start character.<P>

<A HREF=#10>This anchor</A>'s href contains a #, which is not a name
character. The NeXT browser writes all its anchors like this.
Unfortunately, many systems copied this behavior.<P>

<H2>html-mode.el</H2>

See <A NAME=id2 HREF="NeXT">NeXT</A>.<P>

Any known problems? I hear it's going to use
<A NAME=id3 HREF="ftp://ftp.ifi.no/pub/text-processing/sgmls-0.8.tar"
 TYPE="application/x-tar">SGMLs</A>.

<H2>MidasWWW 1.0</H2>

The MidasWWW parses HTML into its internal data structures, and
then offers the option to extract the data and write it to a file.<P>

It doesn't get it right all the time.<P>

Treats all out-of-context tags as data: <foo> <P>

<P>

<H2>www_and_frame</H2>

Go get <A NAME=id5
HREF="ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/www_and_frame-0.3.tar.Z">The
latest version</A> -- it should be current with this spec.<P>
