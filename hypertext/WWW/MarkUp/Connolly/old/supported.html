<TITLE>HTML Writing Guidelines</TITLE>

<H1><A NAME=top>HTML Extremes</A></H1>

These are a little tricky, and might break some quick-and-dirty
implementations. But they must be parsed correctly by all minimally
conforming WWW implementations.<P>

Some of these constructs are markup errors which are not handled
correctly by various browsers.<P>

These constructs are not recommended.<P>

<H2>Text Elements</H2>

<H2>Tags</H2>

<H3    
   >The tags for this element have spaces in them.</H3			>
Just in case it missed the H3 close tag: </H3>

<H3>Names</H3>

A name  should be a letter followed by letter and/or numbers. Case is not significant.<p>

<H4>h4 with different case in start and end tags</h4>

<H2>Normal Text Content</H2>

<H3>Delimiter Recognition</H3>

Character reference: '&#SPACE;' and &#200; and '&#foo;'. The last one
is an error.

And character as data: &, and as markup: &amp;.<P>
And-hash as data: &# and as markup &amp;#.<P>

Less-thans as data: < <1 <-)<P>

Less-than-slash as data: </ </1 </-)<P>

greater-than (pretty much always data): > abc> 0><P>

comment: <!-- foo I'm a comment!--> The sample implementation
groks.<P>

comment w/space between -- and &gt;: <!-- comment w/space -- 	><P>

marked section close without mdc: ]].


markup declaration: <!foo I'm an error!> The sample implementation
treats it as a processing instrcution, so you don't see it.<P>

processing instruction: <?bold lkjsdf > The sample implementation
treats it as a processing instrcution, so you don't see it.<P>


<H2>Literal Text Content</H2>

Doesn't expand entities in RCDATA sections:<P>

<XMP>
Here's the full closing tag: &lt;/XMP&gt;
</XMP>

<XMP>
<!-- this would be a comment in PCDATA. It's data in RCDATA. -->

<! this would be an markup delcaration, which would be an
error in PCDATA. It's data in RCDATA.>

<start> tags are fine!
& as long as it's not followed by a letter or '#', it's fine!
&# is even ok, unless it's followed by a letter or a number.
</XMP>

 Line breaks are significant, and characters are rendered in a fixed-width font to preserve horizontal formatting. <P>

<XMP>
This is literal text with tabs.		THESE	        words
should line up under			THESE		words.

 </XMP>

<H2>Other Elements</H2>

<H3>TITLE</H3>

The TITLE can actually be as long as you like. It can have all the
'&gt;' you want too. It just can't have the ETAGO
delimiter-in-context, that is "&lt;/" followed by a letter. '&amp;'
should be avoided, so that entities can be treated uniformly
throughout HTML.

<H2>Anchors</H2>

<A HREF="#top">name implied</A><P>

<A NAME=xyz>HREF implied</A><P>

<A HREF="#top" NAME=xyz1>HREF before name</A><P>

<A HREF = "#top" NAME = xyz2>spaces around '='</A><P>

<A HREF='spec.html'>single quoted value</A><P>

<A HREF="system:cat&#SPACE;&gt;&#SPACE;file">character references
and entity references in attribute value literal</A><P>

<A NAME=xyz HREF="#xyz">ID already in use</A>
