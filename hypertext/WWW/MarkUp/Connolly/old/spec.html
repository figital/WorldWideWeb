<H1>Hypertext Markup Language</H1>

A Language for Transmission of Global Hyperdocuments.<P>

The World Wide Web project involves the processing of structured
hypertext documents by diverse systems around the globe. The hypertext
documents are represented as marked up text.<P>

The HyperText Markup Language is defined in terms of the ISO Standard
Generalized Markup Language, SGML. The <A NAME=id8
HREF="html.dtd">SGML declaration and document type definition</A>
specify the syntax and structure of HTML.<P>

The following documents describe the HyperText Markup language by
example. They are organized in order of complexity, both for the human
reader and the SGML processing application.<P>

They are intended as an introduction to the language and a guide to
implementors. Note that they do not comprise an integral part of the
HTML specification.<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME=id2 HREF="recommended.html">Recommended</A>
<DD>Examples of how to write HTML that won't stress
the processing software. Some things can't be done
this way.

<DT><A NAME=id3 HREF="complete.html">Complete</A>
<DD>Examples of all the constructs necessary to
produce HTML documents.

<DT><A NAME=id4 HREF="tolerated.html">Tolerated</A>
<DD>Examples of illegal constructs that are supported
for historical reasons.

<DT><A NAME=id5 HREF="required.html">Supported</A>
<DD>These are the constructs supported by the sample implementation.
They are option items like SGML comment declarations.
They are all relatively straighforward to implement, but they
are not so easy to understand.

<DT><A NAME=id6 HREF="deprecated.html">Deprecated</A>
<DD>Some quirks; these are legal SGML,
but they are likely to break existing implementations (including
the sample).

<DT><A NAME=id7 HREF="errors.html">Errors</A>

<DD>These are just plain broken. Implementors should use
these to bullet-proof their code.
