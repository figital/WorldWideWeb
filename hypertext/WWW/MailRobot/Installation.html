<TITLE>Installing the Mail Robot</TITLE>
<NEXTID 3>
<H1>Installation</H1>Here are the steps necessary to install the <A NAME=0 HREF=Overview.html>Mail Robot</A> product on
your unix system.
<H2>Customisation</H2>Set up the variables in <A NAME=1 HREF=Implementation/listserv.h>listserv.h</A> and <A NAME=2 HREF=Implementation/CommonMakefile>CommonMakefile</A> to suit your
site.
<DL>
<DT>POSTMASTER
<DD> The address from which messages appear to come. Why not
listserv? Perhaps to prevent mail loops.
<DT>SECUREWWW
<DD> The executable W3 line mode browser (v1.3 or later, so as
to have the -listrefs option). This is a separate product. For security,
www should be writable only by root.
<DT>SERVERDIR
<DD> The directory in which you want to put your mailing lists
and help about them.
</DL>

<H2>Compile the programs</H2>Everything compiled on AEM's MicroVax II running ULTRIX 3.0 then TBL's
NeXT without any problem at all. Your results may vary.
<H2>Create your SERVDIR</H2>wherever you specified in listserv.h. Install a HELP file, perhaps
using the example-files/HELP in this directory as a template.
<H2>Set up an alias "listserv"</H2>Make an alias in your /etc/aliases (or /etc/sendmail/aliases, whatever
you have) that points to this program, for example:
<XMP>
		listserv:	"|/usr/local/mail/listserv"
		robot:		"|/usr/local/mail/listserv"


</XMP>
<H2>For each mailing list</H2>Create a name.info file giving a bit of information about that mailing
list. see the *.info files in the example-files subdirectory.<P>
Create a name file in the same directory, consisting of email addresses
one to a line of subscribers to a group. If it is for a brand-new
group, create an empty file. Remember that this file must be writable
by the mail daemon. The name of the file is just the name of the group.<P>
Depending on how you have your mailing lists set up, you may need
to add an alias to the /etc/aliases file for each of the mailing lists.
For example:
<XMP>	real-recipes: :include:/usr/local/mail/maillists/recipes

</XMP>So sending mail to real-recipes actually goes to each of the subscribers
listed in /usr/local/mail/maillists/recipes
<H2>Install listserv</H2>Install in the appropriate directory.  Edit the CommonMakefile and
then
<XMP>		make install

</XMP>
<H2>Run newaliases</H2>This gets sendmail to read the changes in /etc/aliases.
<XMP>		newaliases

</XMP>
<H2>Try it out</H2>Send mail to listserv with body
<XMP>
		HELP

</XMP>for example.
