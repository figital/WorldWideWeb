TechInfo                      Techinfo Protocol                       Thu Jun 18
================================================================================

                        TechInfo Server Protocol - V1.0
6/1/90
S. Thorne

      This document outlines the protocol to the TechInfo Server. Much of this
is in flux , and therefore this should only be considered accurate as of
this date.

%      Files or documents must be standard 7 bit ascii in no more than 80
      character rows. Files are sent back and forth with only a LF as an end
      of line character.(This should probable be changed to the standard CRLF)

%      All command lines must end with a  CRLF.

%      Parameters are delimited by a ":".

%      The Techinfo server port is 9000.

%      The Techinfo server sends a banner back when a connection is first
      made.

%      All commands issued to the server should receive some sort of response.

%      Each line of returned information is ended with a CRLF. The end of the
      return information (since it could be any number of lines) is signified
      by a "." on a line by itself (this line is also terminated with a CRLF).
      Therefore when you receive the sequence of CRLF.CRLF the server has
      finished responding, and is waiting for it's next command.

%      Return error messages are strings made up of an error code, and a text
      message delimited with a ":". A zero error code means that the last
      command was successful.

%      All commands are one character followed by any number of parameters
      delimted by colons. These commands should be  followed by a CRLF.

%      The term"base.node.info" will mean a string of the following format.
      <node.id>:<Flags>:<Date>:<Topic>:<Title>:<Source>:<Locker>:<Path>
      node.id is an integer and is the absolute node id of a node.
      Flags is an integer which should be set to 4 when adding a new node.
      Date is an integer - a date in the Unix internal date format divided by
      86400. The rest of the fields are plain text.

%      The term "links.string" will mean a string of node.ids seperated by
      commas.

%      A nodelist is a list of nodes. The first line returned shows the number
of items to expect, the nodes come seperated by LF,  in the format of
      <level #>:<base.node.info>

%      The Techinfo server closess any connections which have been
      inactive for 1440 minutes.



Commands:

      All commands return "0:OK" if successful except where noted.

Command which need Provider authorization:


Add a node.             This adds a new node to the web. The flag field must
be set to 4. The date field is filled in by the server with the date. Returns
the node id assigned.

      a:<base.node.info>

Replace a node      Replaces the base node information of a node, but leaves
the links unchanged.The date field is filled in with the date. You must be the
authorized source of the node.

      r:<base.node.id>

Delete a node      Removes all references to the node. Will not allow a node
with children to be removed. You must be the authorized source of the node.
      x:<node.id>

Link nodes            Create a link. You must be authorized as the source of
the
parent node

      l:<node.id of the parent node>: <links.string of children nodes>

Unlink node      Destroy a link. There is no checking done for orphans.You
must be authorized as the source of the parent node

      u:<node.id of the parent node>:<node.id of child node>

Reorder child links. This command tries to take one nid and move it to the
position of another. It displaces all the children down to make room at
this position. You must be authorized as the source of the parent node

      g:<node id of parent>:<node id of position to displace>:<node id of
child to move>

Provider Mode      Begin a provider session.

      p:<userid>:<password>

End Provider      End a provider session.

      c:

Send a file            Send a file to the server for storage. You must be the
authorized source of the node. Returns an "0:OK" and then expects to get
the file with every line ending with a LF and a final line of just a "." and
CRLF.

      f:<node id>    .......after acknowlegment;....the file.

Commands which require Adminitrator authorization:

      begin as admin      z:<password>

      save the web            y

Command which do not need authorization:

      Send node info      s:<node.id>
      <base.node.info>:<links.string of parents>:<links.string of children>

      get version        v:<machine name>            current client version #
      below                  w:2:<node.id>:<level>      nodelist
      above                  w:1:<node.id>:<level>      nodelist
      search            b:<string>                  nodelist
      map                  w:3:<node.id>:<level>      nodelist
      quit                  q

      Get a document      t:<node.id>:<starting character>:<max # of bytes to
send> - returns an initial line of " # Total Characters:# sent: This
document was last modified on <date>
