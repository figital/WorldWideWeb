<LI><A NAME=1 HREF=WhyHTTP.html>Why a new protocol?</A> , 
<LI><A NAME=7 HREF=RelevantProtocols.html>Other protocols used</A>
<LI>the HTTP protocol as <A NAME=12 HREF=HTTP/AsImplemented.html>currently implemented</A> 
<LI><A NAME=19 HREF=DesignIssues.html>Protocol design issues</A> .
</UL>The definition of this protocol is in the public domain (see <A NAME=17 HREF=../Policy.html>policy</A>
). 
<H2>Underlying protocol</H2>Current HTTP uses  ASCII transmission over a  telnet-style internet
protocol, to make it simple to program, so that it will catch on:
conversion to run over an OSI stack will be simple as the structure
of the messages is well defined.
<H2><A NAME=13>Idempotent</A> </H2>This protocol is stateless, in that no state is kept by the server
on behalf of the client.  (This does not rule out caching by the server
internally).
<H2>Request: Information transferred from client</H2>Parameters below,  however represented on the network, are given in
upper case, with parameter names in lower case. This set assumes a
model of format negociation in which in which the client says what
he can take, and the server decides what to give him. One imagines
that each function would return a status, as well as information specified
below.<P>
When running over a byte stream protocol, SGML would be an encoding
possibility (as well as ASN/1 etc).
<DL>
<DT>GET document_name  <A NAME=23 HREF=../MarkUp/HTRQ.html>HTRQ</A>
<DD> Please transfer a named document back. Transfer
the results back in a standard format or one which I have said I can
accept.
<DT>Request 
<DT>SEARCH  keywords
<DD> Please search the given index document for all items
with the given word combination, and transfer the results back as
marked up hypertext. This could elaborate to an SQL query. There are
many advantages in making the search criterion just a subset of the
document name space. 
<DT>SINCE datetime
<DD> For a search, refer to documents only dated on or after
this date. Used typically for building a journal, or for incremental
update of indexes and maps of the web.
<DT>BEFORE datetime
<DD> For a search, refer to documents before this date
only.
<DT>ACCEPT format penalty
<DD> I can accept the given formats . The <A NAME=3 HREF=Penalties.html>penalty</A>
is a set of numbers giving an estimate of the data degradation and
elapsed time penalty which would be suffered at the CLIENT end by
data being received in this way. Gateways may add or modify these
fields.
<DT><A NAME=5>PORT</A>
<DD> See the <A NAME=4 HREF=rfc959.txt>RFC959</A> PORT command.   We could change the default so
that if the port command is NOT specified, then data must be sent
back down the same link. In an idempotent world, this information
would be included in the <A NAME=10 HREF=#9>GET</A> command.
<DT>HEAD doc
<DD> Like GET, but get only header information. One would have
to decide whether the header should be in SGML or in protocol format
(e.g. RPC parameters or internet mail header format). The function
of this would be to allow overviews and simple indexes to be built
without having to retrieve the whole document.  See the <A NAME=8 HREF=RelevantProtocols.html>RFC977</A> HEAD
command. The process of generation of the header of a document from
the source (if that is how it is derived) is subject to the same possibilties
(caching, etc) as a format convertion from the source.
<DT>USER id
<DD> The user name for logging purposes, preferably a mail address.
Not for authentication unless no other authentication is given.
<DT>AUTHORITY authentication
<DD> A string to be passed across transparently.
The protocol is open to the authentication system used.
<DT>HOST
<DD> The calling host name - useful when the calling host is not properly
registered with a name server.
<DT>Client Software
<DD> For interest only, the application name and version
number of the client software.  These values should be preserved by
gateways.
</DL>

<H2>Response</H2>Suppose the response is an SGML document, with the document type a
function of the status. (<A NAME=16 HREF=HTTP/Ex1.html> Example</A> )
<DL>
<DT>Status
<DD> A status is required in machine-readable format. See the 3-figure
status codes of FTP for example. Bad status codes should be accompanied
by an explantory document, possible conianing links to futher information.
A possibility would be to make an error response a special SGML document
type. Some special status codes are mentioned <A NAME=15 HREF=#14>below</A> .
<DT>Format
<DD> The format selected by the server
<DT>Document
<DD> The document in that format
</DL>

<H2><A NAME=14>Status codes</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT>Success
<DD> Accompanied by format and document.
<DT>Forward
<DD> Accompanied by new address. The server indicates a new address
to be used by the client for finding the document. the document may
have moved, or the server may be a name server.
<DT>Need Authorisation
<DD> The authorisation is not sufficient. Accompanied
by the address prefix for which authorisation is required.  The browser
should obtain authoisation, and use it every time a request is made
for a document name matching that prefix.
<DT>Refused
<DD> Access has been refused. Sending (more) authorization won't
help.
<DT>Bad document name
<DD> The document name did not refer to a valid document.
<DT>Server failure
<DD> Not the client's fault. Accompanied by a natural language
explanation.
<DT>Not available now
<DD> Temporary problem - trying at a later time might
help.  This does not i,ply anything about the document name and authorisation
being valid. Accompaned by a natural language explaination.
<DT>Search fail
<DD> Accompanied by a  HTML hit-list without any hits, but
possibly containing a natural explanation.
