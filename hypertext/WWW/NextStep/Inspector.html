<H1>The document inspector panel</H1>This panel allows you to see the
addresses of the current document,
and the documents to which it is
linked. You bring it up using the
<A

by its WWW address. You can  also
make links to documents given only
their address, without having to
load them. <P>
The items on the inspector panel
are as follows.
<H2>Title field</H2>This displays the title of the document
and allows you to edit it.  The title

and click on the "Set" button or
press RETURN.  The stored file will
not be affected until you have saved
the document.

address of the document in the main
