<H1>Searching an index</H1>The <A
NAME=0 HREF="WorldWideWeb.html">WWW</A> application allows you to
serach a remote index or database.
<P>
A searchable object is represented
as a normal document, but you will
notice the search panel appears whenever
the document in the main window is
such an object.<P>
Whenever the serach panel is visible,
you may fill in text if your query.
This may be one or several words,
or a query expressed in some language.
  Use a few keywords unless instructions
in the searchable document explain
otherwise. <P>
Press return, or clickon the "Search"
button.  A document is returned which
has been generated by the remote
server.  Often, this contains pointers
to other documents which match your
query. In other cases, it contains
the inormation you want in the document
itself.</BODY>
