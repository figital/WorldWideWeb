<H1>IHEP</H1>TIn Beijing they have currently an
internal DECnet nd TCP/IP, with external
Decnet and X25 but no IP.<P>
A new 64kb/s  IP line is to go in
to SLAC (part of a T1 sattelite link)
at the end of this year.    I suggested
we wait until this link is in before
installing W3 software.
<H2>BEPC2</H3>There are several VAX/VMS machines,
including a VAX/785 BEPC2:: which
has a dial-up 9600 line to SLAC over
which they run DECNet over DDCMP.
From vxcrna,<P>
set host/x29 0460220100110<P>
BEPC2 runs multinet.
