<TITLE>Welcome to the Universe of HyperText</TITLE>

<H1>Work Plan PT Group: Hypertext Project</H1>
<ADDRESS>R.Cailliau
</ADDRESS>
<H2>Reminder</H2>The Hypertext project, called "World Wide Web" (W3) is described in more detail in a memo of 12 November 1990. We give here only a short review. W3 aims at providing access to documents independently of where they are stored and which format they are in. In a first phase, only simple text is handled, and only a limited number of access stations are provided with browsers. There are two closely related activities: work on FIND and on the Particle Data Group data base, described separately.
<H2>Current status</H2>W3 is implemented by a joint ECP - CN team, consisting of T.Berners-Lee (CN), R.Cailliau (ECP), K.Gieselmann (ECP), N.Pellow (CN, student), B. Pollermann (CN).<P>
A browser-editor for the NeXT is running, accessing local and remote files in various formats, internet news and remote hypertext servers.<P>
A prototype browser for DEC VMS from VT100 type terminals is under construction (N.Pellow).<P>
Work on the browser for Apple Macintosh has started (R.Cailliau).<P>
The requirements analysis of the information/documentation needs of a large experiment has started (R.Cailliau).<P>
A server is running on CERNVM providing the "Find" information to the hypertext world.<P>
The working documentation of the project is kept in hypertext form.<P>
Dates are as follows:<P>
-	A browser on the Macintosh in the Macintosh style: working prototype in April.<P>
-	A requirements analysis of the information access needs for a large experiment: by end April.<P>
-	requirements analysis for one other experiment: by June.<P>
-	a server for CERN news, people, phone numbers, mail addresses and Yellow Pages: end February.
<H2>Resources required</H2>
<H3>1. People</H3>We repeat here the list of functions required for successful implementation:<P>
-	System architect.<P>
-	Market research and product planner.<P>
-	Hyper-Librarian.<P>
-	5 Software engineers.
<H3>2. Other resources</H3>While we have most of the tools needed for the job, the following are important:<P>
-	space:  the W3 team would like to regroup in one geographically close set of offices.<P>
-	machines: each person working on the project will require a state-of-the-art workstation.  The current situation may be satisfactory for the rest of 1991.<P>
-	Purchase of licenses or commercial hypertext software: this may be the largest expense for 1991.<P>
-	Computing support: reliable backed up NFS (or equivalent) file server support for our development environment: achieved for now.<P>
-	Support from operators and system managers: ?
<H2>Maintaining the FIND information</H2>FIND is the information facility available on VM/CMS, mentioned before. K.Gieselmann is responsible for monitoring the usage of this tool, evaluating users' needs, creating and writing help files as well as improving existing ones, and accessing a large number of service processes. The project leader is B.Pollermann from CN Division.
<H2>PDG (Particle Data Group) data base</H2>The Particle Data Group in Berkeley maintains a data base of physics particle properties. The work is divided over several institutes. K.Gieselmann is technical associate and contact person at CERN, responsible for the maintenance of the MESON section of the database. This work requires knowledge of ORACLE /SQL and of the RPP Database Encoding Schema, as well as a basic understanding of particle properties. The project leader for CERN is L.Montanet from PPE Division. This activity occurs in three periods of 3 to 4 weeks each. It is as yet unclear how these data are to be integrated into W3.
