<NEXTID 6>
<H1>WWW Work Plan for AS group 1991</H1>This is a contribution from the <A NAME=2 HREF=../TheProject.html>WWW</A> project to the AS group work plan
for 1991.  (See the previous AS group <A NAME=3 HREF=http://crnvmc/FIND/PUB.CNL.:CNL.200_1__1(X/G/H)>work plan for 1990 ). </A><P>
Note that this phase requires more manpower than we currently have.
we will require a replacement for Nicola Pellow who leaves at the
end of the summer, plus one more programmer.<P>
1991 sees the end of the initial phase of the WWW project. The existence
of two browsers in extremely different environments, two  servers
in extremely different environments, several large indexes and a web
of many hypertext documents has proven the viability of the system.
The next phase of the project implements its penetration onto all
platforms, and extension to groups outside the CERN site.  
<H2>General</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Implement format negociation feature of the protocol to allow exchange
and conversion of differing data formats.
<LI>Implement document caching for documents it takes a long time to retrieve
or convert.
</UL>
<H2>Browsers</H2>
<H3>Line Mode Browser</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Implement reverse scrolling, and various requested features
<LI>Increase penetration to all CERN machine types
<LI>Integrate Internet news access mechanism
<LI>Public release to academic/H.E.P. community.
</UL>
<H3>NeXTStep Browser</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Integrate Anonymous-FTP access mechanism
<LI>Prepare for release to the academic NeXTStep community for comment
</UL>
<H3>X Browser</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Develop.   Manpower requirement  exceeds that of phase 0, so this
item cannot be scheduled for 1991 without additional resources.  An
IBM/PC browser would also be considered if the manpower were increased.	
</UL>
<H3>Mac Browser</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Develop browser for Macintosh.
</UL>
<H2>Servers and Data Provision</H2>
<UL>
<LI>WHO data from CERNVM (see DE section work plan)
<LI>Develop and distribute generic unix server for man pages etc, including
indexing using public domain code;
<LI>VMS server for VMS/HELP files
<LI>Set up librarian services for catalogues of available data, and overview
documents.
</UL>
<H2>External contacts</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Other information service software projects, e.g. <A NAME=4 HREF=../../Products/Overview.html#18>W.A.I.S.</A> ) and hypertext
projects (e.g. <A NAME=5 HREF=../../Products/DynaText/Overview.html>DynaText</A> ).
<LI>Awareness of, distribution to,  and feedback from H.E.P.  groups:
experiments, other labs.
<LI>Collaboration with other information providers, such as research networks
user support (CONCISE etc), Archie, existing W.A.I.S. servers, etc.
