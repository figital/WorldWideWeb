large membership.

those developing WWW software or
with that deep an interest. Also

For your privacy, the membership
lists of these groups are not publicly
accessible. They will be reflected
to newsgroups at Cern shortly, perhaps
on Internet later.<P>
Most of the information you need
on World-Wide Web is in our hypertext
documentation, accessible either
from your local WWW browser as http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/<A
NAME=6 HREF="../../TheProject.html">
TheProject.html</A> or by telnet to info.cern.ch
or 128.141.201.74 (automatic login).
Anonymous FTP to the same machine
can provide you with the latest releases
in source, and binaries for certain
machines. You can also fetch "paper"
documentation (articles, WWW Book,...)
in PostScript, LaTeX or ASCII form.
The relevant directories are src,
bin and doc, all under /pub/www.<P>
The following mail addresses exist
for your convenience. You cannot
subscribe to them. Again, all addresses
are @info.cern.ch.

<DT>www-request
<DD> If you want to talk to
a human being about list subscriptions.
<DT>www-bug

Cern who can assist you with the
various WWW products. This is a voluntary
support service, all we can guarantee
is a response, but we'll do our best
to help you !
