<LI>Provision of a browser for X11-based machines;
<LI>Detailed analysis of individual experiments' information system needs,
and provision of tools to fulfil these;
<LI>Implementation of the format negociation aspect of the W3 protocol
</UL>In fact, much time was spent largely tuning the system in response

MVS,  for use at DESY, Hamburg;
<LI>The software was released on the internet for international comment;
<LI>Contact was made with external group interested in providing software
effort;
<LI>Preliminary discusions with experiments and investigation by Mike
Sendall have lead to a preliminary list of information sources to

<LI>Template <A NAME=2 HREF=../../Daemon/Overview.html>gateway software</A> was made available to allow existing information
sources to be quickly incorporated into the web.
<LI>A gateway was produced to VMS/HELP to allow existing data held (mainly
by HEP experiments) in VMS/HELP form to be made accesible;
<LI>The CERN white pages telephone book was put on-line;
<LI>A gateway was produced to allow the growing number (currently 80)
of <A NAME=1 HREF=../../../Products/WAIS/Overview.html>WAIS</A> servers to be accessed from WWW clients;
<LI>Using seed money from ECP division, a media server machine was ordered
to serve as a multimedia server including FAX capability, as discussions
showed that much information to be shared was not in machine-readable
form;
<LI>The maintenance of the browsers including suggestions from users and
bug fixes involved 12 minor releases.
