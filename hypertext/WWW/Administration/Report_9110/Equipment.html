<H1>Equipment</H1>The equipment needs to of the project are basically workstations for
members of the team, and a server machine. We will add to this scanning
and communications hardware to allow us to experiment with taking<A NAME=1>
hard copy input</A> and put it online, and to transmit and receive documents
by fax.<P>
NeXT Inc's kind provision of a <A NAME=2>workstation</A> in the context of a joint
project, project "seed" money from ECP division, and  workstations
provided from individual group budgets have allowed this equipment
level to be achieved. _________________________________________________________________
