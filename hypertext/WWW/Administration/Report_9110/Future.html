<TITLE>Future -- /Report_9110</TITLE>
<NEXTID 5>
<H1>Future directions</H1>Our technical agenda remains much as it was <A NAME=1 HREF=SecondSixMonths.html#4>six months ago</A> . We have
refined our ideas of what support tools are necessary, and added many
more. We have also identified that effort must be spent in the areas
of:-
<DL>
<DT>Service Mode
<DD> As the web grows, the "librarian" job of insuring the
integrity and availability of the data becomes more important. Our
philosophy to date has been to provide only the software infrastructure:
can we avoid this.  See <A NAME=2 HREF=ServiceMode.html>details</A> .
<DT>External liason
<DD> If we continue to allow the project to spread outside
the bounds of CERN, this takes <A NAME=4 HREF=Groups.html>time</A>;
<DT>User contact
<DD> To date our contact with HEP users has been insufficient.
We must examine more closely how we can be of direct use to HEP groups.
Of course, generic developments have a higher payoff that user-cusomised
developments, so we will be biased toward groups with common needs,
or who show a lot of enthusiasm.
<DT>Format conversion tools
<DD> We intend to provide the framework for documents
to be exchanged in many formats, with conversionas necessary.  (This
feature will also allow the automatic opening of X-window or telnet
sessions to programs on servers). A result of this feature will be
that we start to be concerened with format conversion programs, as
our system will depend on them. This suggests we should join forces
with those expert(s) in CERN in text markup conversion.
