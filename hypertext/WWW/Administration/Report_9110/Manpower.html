<TITLE>Manpower -- /Report_9110</TITLE>
<NEXTID 8>
<H1>Manpower</H1>The initial proposal estimated a <A NAME=5 HREF=../../Proposal.html#6>requirement</A> for 5 software developers
with various skills, and one hyper-librarian to manage information
sources.<P>
In practice,  we have had on average 3.5 people working on the project.
Bernd Pollermann has worked full time on the FIND server. Tim Berners-Lee
has worked full time coordiating the project and writing server and
client software. Robert Cailliau has worked 50% of the time on the
project, mainly on discussion of W3 with other groups, and on a Mac
browser. Nicolla Pellow, a technical student, worked 100% on the project
until leaving in August 1990. Jean-Francois Groff, a "cooperant",
has just joined us for six months. Karin Gieselmann has had to abandon
the idea of helping us due to health problems and impending early
retirement. No other programmer was found to help with the X11 browser.
<H2>Conditions of work</H2>The project members are divided over two divisions and located in
two distinct <A NAME=6 HREF=../../Proposal.html#8>areas</A>, factores which have not been beneficial to productivity.
For the time being, this split is tolerable, a compensating advantage
being the connects with both divisions' other units.<P>
Equipment has been <A NAME=4 HREF=Equipment.html>sufficient</A> .
<H2>External contacts</H2>Both TBL and RC have spent some time liasing with interested <A NAME=2 HREF=Groups.html>groups</A>
outside CERN. This is partly because it became clear that to cover
a wide spectrum of browsers and servers, outside effort would be necessary.<P>
It also became obvious that there is much equivalent work going on
in the information systems field, and it was felt that for the good
of CERN we should align ourselves with common practices and standards
as much as possible.<P>
As a result of these contacts,
<UL>
<LI>We have an offer from a univeristy for some students to make an X11/Motif
browser as a student project;
<LI>We have an offer of help from another university to make a PC-based
browser;
<LI>We have a contribution of some <A NAME=7 HREF=Equipment.html#2>hardware</A> from NeXT, Inc.
</UL>Offers of help can of course only be evaluated after the event, and
it should be remembered that liason with ecternal groups can also
take a lot of time.<P>
<A NAME=3 HREF=Future.html>More...</A><P>
