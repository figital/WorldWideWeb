<XMP>Tim-

I asked to follow w3 for the nis (network information service)
at cerf.net.  I am impressed with the web  and want to stay
current of your new development and resources.

As you know you are involved in vital new work.
I would appreciate learning  of papers or books
or ftp archieves that  will increase my knowledge
of your activities.

Thank you!
-Bruce
