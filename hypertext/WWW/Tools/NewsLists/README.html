<TITLE>Updating the hypertext lists of newsgroups</TITLE>
<NEXTID 4>
<H1>Updating the Newsgroup lists</H1>To update some of the news pages automatically you must be logged
on to the news server or have the news directories mounted.<P>
 Carl mentioned that you must be a member of the UNIX group news (otherwise
you won't have permission to read the news directories) but that doesn't
seem to be necessary for these functions.
<H2><A NAME=0 HREF=UpgateGroups>UpdateGroups</A></H2>This script updates the list of newsgroups. For the <A NAME=1 HREF=../../../DataSources/News/Groups/Overview.html>overview list</A>
, it saves everything before the "Others" heading, and adds on a list
of pointers to newsgroup stems not already mentioned in the saved
hypertext.<P>
For each stem, it saves any command before the glossary list of groups,
and then regenerates that list of groups.
<H2><A NAME=2 HREF=NewsPage_Update>NewsPage_Update</A> (old)</H2>The script NewsPage_Update creates complete lists of active groups
for the following groups: alt, bionet, bit, biz, cern, ch, comp, eunet,
gnu, news, rec, sci, soc, talk, vmsnet. It does this by writing the
header in explicitly for each group, and then generating a list of
of subgroups using FindGroups<P>
For comp and news, a full list is placed in fullcomp.html and fullnews.html.
 The files comp.html and news.html are formatted by hand already,
and so are not touched by the script.<P>
NewsPage_Update works by writing some HTML text into a file for each
group to be updated, called [newsgroup_name].html.new, then calling
the script FindNewsGroups.  This checks the file /usr/local/lib/news/newsgroups
for the groups within the current group which are active.  Finally
the new file is renamed to remove the .new.<P>
The list of stems to search, and their titles and any other comment
is hardcoded into the NewsPage_Update script, and the list is DUPLICATED
in Others_Update.
<H2><A NAME=3 HREF=Others_Update>Others_Update</A></H2>The Others_Update script finds stems which are not included in the
Overview.html file, but which are active.  This list of which groups
not to include is hardcoded into the script.  For each group, it calls
GrpCreate.  This adds the name to OtherGroups/Overview.    It then
runs FindNewsGroups for each group.
<H3>NOTE</H3>Once the script has completed all the .new groups must be renamed
manually to remove the .new extension.
<H2>GrpCreate</H2>This reads a newsgroup stem name from stdin.<P>
It then creates the top of a file for the list of groups with that
stem. This will be called ${nn}.html.new. where ${nn} is the stem
name. Unfortunately there is no way to get a description of the stem
to include in this file. However, if the .html fie already exists,
it will use everything up to an excluding the first DL tag from the
.html file for the .html.new file. Therefore, everything above the
DL tag may be hand edited.<P>
GrpCreate adds a pointer from OtherGroups/Overview.html.new to the
.html file.<P>
The .html file is renamed .html.old, and teh .html.new becomes .html,
with diffs being stored in a .diffs file under the date.</A>
