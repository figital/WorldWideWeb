This message will appear if external circuits go down to DECnet areas with
no backup routes. Connectivity is lost either due to PTT disruption on the
leased line or problems with equipment at the remote end. If the alarm shows
more than one DECnet circuit down there may be problems with equipment locally
at CERN.
