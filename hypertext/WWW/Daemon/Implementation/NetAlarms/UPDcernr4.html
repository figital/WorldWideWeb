<TITLE>HOW TO MAKE UPDATES ON CERNR4</TITLE>

CERNR4 is intended for use as an X25router connector node for VXCRNA
(and possibly for other nodes running PSI Access software). It is also
a router for area 23 and should therefore always be up and running -
only occassional reboots to modify the configuration are tolerated.

Below is a recipe for modifying the CERNR4 configuration:
<XMP>
   Note: Most of the commands below can be executed on either UXCOMS,
         VXGIFT or UXCSB1. However, to downline load the new image
         to CERNR4 you must be logged in to UXCSB1.

<LI>1. Make sure the symbols defined in decnet$cernr4:cernr4_symbols.com
   are defined on your system (e.g. by defining them in your login.com).
<LI>2. Type "cernr4" so that you change your default directory
<LI>3. Edit the relevant files in this directory to make the changes you
   require. Use comments (preceeded by "!") to explain the modifications.
<LI>4. Type "cernr4_config" to enter the configuration program for the
   permanent data base. After the prompt, execute any command files
   that you changed and then exit.   e.g.
<XMP>

       X25ROUPERM> @dte.com
       X25ROUPERM> exit

</XMP>
   You have now updated the permanent data base. Note that you can check
   your changes by using the 'SHOW' command before you exit.
<LI>5. Type "cernr4_copy" to copy the permanent data to the backup copy on UXDDB1.(This is only possible from VXGIFT::OGILVIE and UXCOMS::OGILVIE and 
    UXCSB1::OGILVIE, in an emergency the Operations Group should have
    sufficient privileges to help. The file to be copied is<P>
    sys$common:[decserver]x25cernr4.sys).
<LI>6. Type "cernr4_load" to download the updated permanent data base to CERNR4.This command can only be executed on UXCSB1 since this is the only
CS cluster machine configured to allow down-line loading.
<LI>7. To check that the new configuration is loaded correctly, type<P>
$ mc ncp tell cernr4 show ....
