<H1>Program RESPONSIBLE J.N. Gamble GROUP CN/CS Tele. 3105</H1>

This is one of the CERN level 2 DECNET routers. If this is DOWN then
DECnet communication to USA and PSI (Paul Scherer Institute) in Switzerland may be degraded. Normally, all countries have backup routes so DECnet should still be running, although response may be slow.
