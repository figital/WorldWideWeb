<TITLE>DECNET no area information from ...</TITLE>
<H1>Program RESPONSIBLE J.N. Gamble  GROUP CN/CS  Tele. 3105</H1> 

The DECNET router does not respond to management requests. Its state is 
therefore unknown. This is not a normal situation but does not necessarily
indicate a problem with the router itself. If other alarm messages are
displayed there could ethernet problems on segment GATE. Check that the
LED display on the back of this router shows two rotating vertical bars
(indicating normal running).
