>mpmon:No response from <1> : CERNR1 *

This is one of the CERN level 2 DECNET routers. If this is DOWN then
DECnet communication may be lost to Spain, UK and Nordunet.

                   This is an Important Node

>mpmon:No response from <1> : CERNR2 *

This is one of the CERN level 2 DECNET routers. If this is DOWN then
DECnet communication may be lost to France and Switzerland.

                   This is an Important Node

>mpmon:No response from <1> : CERNIT *

This the CERN level 2 DECNET router for ITALY (INFN). If this is DOWN then
DECnet communication may be lost to Italy.

>mpmon:No response from <1> : CERNFR *

This the CERN level 2 DECNET router for FRANCE (SACLAY,IN2P3). If this is 
DOWN then DECnet communication may be lost to France.

>mpmon:No response from DNCP : <1> *

One of the central machines (<1>) is no longer responding to DECnet NCP 
commands. The state of this computer needs to be verified.

                   <1> is an Important Node

>dlimon:DECNET no area information from <1>
The DECNET router <1> does not respond to management requests. Its state is 
therefore unknown. Currently there is a problem with the router software 
and this occurs frequently. However the router may be genuinly broken so see 
the documentation for more information on the procedures to follow.

>dlimon:DECNET circuit <1> on router <2> *
The external line <1> connected to our on site router <2> is no longer
operational. These lines connect CERN with external DECNET, some have automatic
backup and some do not. If the state is DOWN then the situation is unforseen.
If the state is OFF then the circuit has been switched off manually.

The following circuits have backup routes and if an alarm is displayed it 
generally means there is a degradation in DECnet service to the country listed:

        INFN            (main circuit to Italy)
        USA             (main circuit to USA)
        X25-CH          (main circuit to Switzerland)
        X25-IN2P3       (main circuit to France)

The following circuits have NO backup route and if an alarm is displayed
it means that DECnet connectivity to the country listed is lost:

        X25-SPAIN       (only circuit to Spain)
        X25-NORDUNET    (only circuit to Scandanavian countries)
        X25-UK          (only circuit to UK)

>dlimon:DECNET area <1> <2> *
This indicates that all DECNET connections to area <1> have been lost
and that this area <2> is no longer reachable. This message will appear
if external circuits go down to areas with no backup routes.
