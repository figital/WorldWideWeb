This DECnet circuit linking CERN with an external site is DOWN.
Normally the DECnet traffic will be re-routed so DECnet connectivity
will not be lost however response may be slow. <P>

The main reason for a DECnet circuit to go down is due to disruption
on a PTT leased line. It may also be due to work on equipment at the
remote site. If more than one alarm is dispalyed for DECnet circuits
then there may be a problem locally at CERN.
