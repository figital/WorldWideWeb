<TITLE>DIAGNOSING X25 ACCESS PROBLEMS ON CERNR4</TITLE>

<H2>Log Files</H2>
CERNR4 logs some events, such as failed calls, in the file:
<XMP>
     DECNET$LOG:NETEVENTS.LOG

</XMP>
This file is renamed at midnight to decnet$log:netevents.old and the last
10 versions are kept.<P>
This file is shared by all DECrouters at CERN. To find specific entries related
to CERNR4, search the file for the string 'cernr4'.
<XMP>

</XMP>
<H2>TRACE</H2>
The commands to trace all X25 Level 3 traffic on CERNR4 are given below. Note
that this will create a LOT OF DATA in files called trace.dat in your current
directory. Running trace for 3-10 mins is usually long enough. The trace
command may only be possible from UXCSB1.
<XMP>
        $ set proc/priv=oper
        $ trace/router start cernr4"cern tracex25"::x25l3line

        .... now let trace run for a few minutes ....

        $ trace/router stop
        $ trace/router analyze/out=trace.lis/data=ascii/wid=80
        $ set proc/priv=nooper

</XMP>
The result of the trace will be in the file trace.lis in your current
directory. You can now scan this with the editor, for example.<P>

A full desription of the X25router trace facility along with other diagnosis
facilities is contained in the section 'Problem Solving Guide' of the X25router
2000 manual. There is a copy on the shelf behind the desk of Denise Heagerty (Bld 31-2-016).
