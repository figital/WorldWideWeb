<TITLE>DebugServer -- /User</TITLE>
<NEXTID 4>
<H1>Running under shell</H1>You don't have to run the daemon under the inted if it doesn't work.
You can run it from a shell session.<P>
If the daemon is httpd, then run it from your terminal, with a different
port number like 8000.  You use <A NAME=2 HREF=CommandLine.html#12>the -a option</A> . 
<XMP>		httpd -v a \*:8000

</XMP>Note: You must be root (under VMS, have some privilege) to run with
a port number below 1024. You can't use a port number which has been
used by a daemon process recently, so you may have to switch port
number if you ^C and restart the daemon.When it is running like this,
you can read the trace messages and use a debugger on it if necessary.

If the server is a shell script "myserver", try just running it with
the terminal and typing GET /documentname into its stdin.<P>
