<H1>"Connection Refused"</H1>The browser tries to connect to the daemon but gets this status in
the trace. <P>
This means that noone was listening on that port number. Check the
port numbers match btween server and client.  Make sure you specify
the port number explicitly in the document address for www.<P>
If you are running the daemon without the inet daemon, (with the -a
option) then try running it from the terminal with -v as well.  The
trace for the server should say "socket, bind and listen all ok".
If it does, and you still get "connection refused", then you must
be talking to the wrong host (or, conceivably, different ethernet
adapters on the same host)<P>
If you are running with the inet daemon, then check both the services
file (/etc/service) or database (yellow pages, netinfo) if your system
uses it,  and the /etc/inetd.conf file. Check the service name matches
between these two.<P>
Did you remember to kill -HUP the inet daemon when you changed the
inted.conf file?<P>
