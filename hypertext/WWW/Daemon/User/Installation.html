<H1>Installing te basic httop daemon</H1>The usual way to install a daemon is to either run it from the bootstrap
command file (for example /etc/rc) so that it runs continuously, or
to set up the internet daemon (inetd) to run it when a call comes
in. <P>
Remember to make a <A NAME=5 HREF="RuleFile.html">rule file</A> unless you explicitly supress it with
the -R option.
<H2><A NAME=2>Using the Internet daemon</A></H2>There is a csh script to do this for a BSD unix system. You might
want to edit it to run on other systems. <P>
Otherwise, just follow the <A NAME=9 HREF="Inetd.html">instructions for installing a server under
the internet daemon</A>.
<H2>Log file</H2>If  a log file is required,  make sure that the user name under which
the daemon is run  has the right to write the file
