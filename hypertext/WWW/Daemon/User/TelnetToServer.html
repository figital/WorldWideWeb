<TITLE>TelnetToServer -- /User</TITLE>
<NEXTID 2>
<H1>Telnetting to a server</H1>Most implementations of telnet allow you to specify a port number.
Under unix this is often just a second parameter, under VMS a /PORT
option.<P>
The <A NAME=1 HREF=../../Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html>HTTP protocol</A> is a telnet protocol, so you can simulate it just
by typing things in.  This will help you to see exactly what a sending
back, and it will check you that it really is the server not the browser
which has a problem.<P>
Here is an example. (You type "telnet..." and  "GET ...").
<XMP>	> telnet myhost.domain 80
	Connected to myhost.domain on port 80
	Escape is ^[
	GET /documentname
	<PLAINTEXT>
	Document name "/documentname" invalid.
