<h1>System 33 Gateway</h1>
This csh
<a href=gateway>script</a> is by Steve Putz of Xerox PARC 
and is a good example of how to write a W3 server in csh.

Apart from retrieve system33 documents, it gets lot of other things as well,
including files and man pages (in plain text), and the Xerox phone book.
