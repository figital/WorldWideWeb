<NEXTID 10>
<H1>Gateway to VMS Help: Internals</H1>These are technical and installation notes about the <A NAME=1 HREF=../VMSHelp/Overview.html>gateway to VMS
Help</A> . Please send bug reports and suggestions to <A NAME=2 HREF=../People.html#groff>Jean-Francois Groff</A>
(jfg@cernvax.cern.ch).
<H2>Sources</H2>The program consists of the generic daemon <A NAME=3 HREF=Implementation/HTDaemon.c>HTDaemon.c</A> , and a special
function, stored in <A NAME=4 HREF=Implementation/VMSHelpGate.c>VMSHelpGate.c</A> , to retrieve VMS Help data and
convert it to HTML.
<H2>Installation</H2>The files you need are as follows. You should customise them, putting
in your own directory names.:
<DL>
<DT><A NAME=7 HREF=Implementation/VMSHelp/launchgate.com>launchgate.com</A>
<DD>Runs the server as a detached process. Put a call to
this from your sys$startup procedure, wherever that is. This detaches
a job to use www_server.com ans input, and a log file as output.
<DT><A NAME=8 HREF=Implementation/VMSHelp/www_server.com>www_server.com</A>
<DD>The server command file, a wrapper for the actual server
executable.  In this file, set the temporary directory for the storage
of a cache of .HLP files. This file runs the executable.
<DT><A NAME=9 HREF=Implementation/VMSHelp/test.com>test.com</A>
<DD>Here is just an example of  a file to build and test the server.
<DT><A NAME=5 HREF=Implementation/VMSHelp/descrip.mms>descrip.mms</A>
<DD>This is an MMS file to build the executable. If you don't
have MMS, you may be able to figure out from loking at it which commands
you should use.  You can find a machine running MMS and generate the
equivalent .com files. See comments at the top of this file on how
to run it.
</DL>
The source files and executable .EXE are currently (October 92) available
on HEP  decnet in vxcrna::disk$d1:[jfg.www...].  Note also you can
pick up the master sources from dxcern:: automatically by running
<P>
MMS /MACRO=(U=DXCERN::).<P>
If you are not in HEP decnet, you should find the sources in the WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z
file in the distribution. See the <A NAME=6 HREF=../../README.html>README file</A>.<P>
