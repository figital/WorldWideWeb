<TITLE>Handling protocol version mismatches</TITLE>
<NEXTID 3>
<H1>Communicating with different versions of HTTP</H1>
<h2>One way:</h2>
Let "IT" be either the browser, sending a request,  or the server
sending a document, and let "ME" be the server getting a request or
the browser receiving a document.<P>
ME  will find in the received data the number v(IT) of the HTTP version
used by IT. If this number is different from the version v(ME) it
uses itself, then:
<DL>
<DT>v(ME) = v(IT)
<DD>No problem.
<DT>v(ME) = v(IT)+1:
<DD> ME should downgrade to the previous version, which
ME is supposed to know. IT will bring the problem to the attention
of its user (but see <A NAME=2 HREF=ProtocolProblems.html#1>silencing</A> )
<DT>v(ME) > v(IT)+1
<DD> An alert is given to the user of ME. No further communication
can proceed.
</DL>
All features of HTTP version n and n-1 are always implemented. To
implement downgrading, it is sufficient to keep a list of flags. In
fact, a set of such lists could be used to downgrade several levels
back, but this should not be done.<P>
<h2>Another way:</h2>
[Tim] This came out of rpc project thinking on version upgrade
 for client and server software modules which never
made it into the software  but seemed to cover the needs,
and would have solved some real problems in a large distributed system.
<p>
Suppose there is a sequence of versions. For each new version,
the changes may make a server of that version incompatible
with earlier clients before a certain version.
<p>Similarly but independently, a client of the new version may or
may not be compatible with servers of earlier versions.
<p>
There is a sort of cross-compatibility map but you can simplify it
by assuming that if you are incompatible with old version V then you
 are also incompatible with old versions <V.
Your incompatibility is then summed up by:
Your current version V(you) and the earliest version of it which you can
tolerate Vmin(it).  To do the compatibility check in one
go, the requester sends over its two numbers V(c) and VMin(s).
The server has the two numbers V(s) and VMin(c).
The server then checks that V>=Vmin for both s and c and if so all is fine.
<p>
This leaves open still the possibility of saying "Please rephrase that".
Note I am sticking to the single request-reply model always for speed.
