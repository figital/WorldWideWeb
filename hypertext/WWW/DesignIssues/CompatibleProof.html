<H1>Proof that HTTP 1.0 is compatible with 0.9</H1>
<H3>Assume:</H3>version 1.0 has the version number at the end of the GET for the browser
and inside an HTML tag for the server. Then:
<XMP>  Browser   Server
    old      old            OK.
    new      old            new browser can handle 0.9 anyway.
    new      new            OK.
    old      new            old browser never sends anything but
                                 GET string
                            with no version number, so then it must be 0.9.
