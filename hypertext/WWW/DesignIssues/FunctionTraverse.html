<H1>Link Traversing</H1>
<H2>Normal documents</H2>Traversing a link will normally result in the display of the document
identified by the UDI at the tail anchor. However, there are two exceptions:
forward documents and elaborated documents.
<H2>Forward documents </H2>There are two reasons for having forward documents:<P>
1) a document is moved; the forward document has the old UDI and contains
the new UDI.<P>
2) a document is generic, eg. "This month's report"; the forward document
has a published UDI and contains the UDI of the currently relevant
document.
<H3>Case 1:</H3>Situation: document X (existing) at location (a) references document
D (the one we want) in location (b). Document N  (new) at location
(a) is a newly created one.<P>
Document D is moved to location (c). A forward document F replaces
it at (b). F contains "(c).D" and itself must have UDI "(b).D"<P>
(a UDI has the form x.y.z... where some of the dots could actually
be slashes, but this is not relevant here).<P>
When the browser at (a) follows the link from X, it references "(b).D"
The server at (b) will now have to return the response "forward to
(c).D", and it must do so from knowledge stored at (b). It could keep
a list or any other record that D has moved, but in our model we will
use the file system, by adding an extension: document F is in the
file "D.html.f", the server looks for "D.html" first, then tries "D.html.f"
and thereby knows that D does exist after all. The browser gets the
information about D's true location, and automatically gets it. Although
the server could get D, this should not be done because there could
be a chain of forwards and the server would have to pass the browser's
profile along it, maybe finding out-of-date servers on the way. The
browser should follow the chain (at no extra cost in number of exchanges).<P>
At (a) the user has D represented, and makes a link to it from N.
The anchor will contain "(c).D" viz. the UDI of the real D.<P>
If there is a long chain of forwards, then UDIs get substituted until
the end of the chain is reached.
<H3>Case 2:</H3>Situation: At location (c) exists a set of documents, JA (January),
FE (February), MA (March) etc. At location (b) exists a document T
(this month's report) which contains the UDI of this month's report,
which happens to be "(c).MA". Document X (existing) at location (a)
references document T  by "(b).T". Document N  (new) at location (a)
is a newly created one.<P>
The mechanism of getting at (c).MA and displaying it can be the same
as for case 1, but document T is not like F of case 1: if the user
wants to put a link to this month's report in N, (s)he would be very
surprised if this link always referred to (c).MA. Instead, this link
should continue to refer to T, so that it really is "this month's
report" and not "March". Therefore, a different extension should be
used for T, for example "g" instead of "f", and the server's response
is different.<P>
There may be a chain of forward documents with a generic in the middle,
and as soon as the browser finds such a response, it sticks to that
UDI rather than continuing to substitute UDIs.<P>
[Note:can anyone think of a useful case of a chain of generics?]
<H2>Elaborated documents</H2>An elaborated document contains a possibly arbitrarily complex algorithm
for constructing the information to be displayed. Like a forward document,
when a link to an elaborated document is followed, the algorithm is
executed and the result is returned. Whereas a forward document uses
the WWW built-in mechanisms to get at the contents, the elaborated
document is designed to use external software to do the job. <P>
In general, the algorithm makes sense only at the server's site, and
the server will have to (a) recognise that the requested document
is to be constructed by elaboration of the algorithm and (b) start
and possibly control the software doing the construction.<P>
There are two issues:<P>
1) how to construct and edit the algorithm using WWW,<P>
2) how to make external software execute the algorithm.<P>
Editing can only be done by using an option in the browser whereby
the author of the elaborated document addresses it with a specific
request to return the algorithm, not the result. This is a special
request to the server<P>
