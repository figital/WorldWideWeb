<H1>Design Notes</H1>These are points arising from discussions, etc. Note most of the design
goes straight into the web in place, not here.  This is mostly historical.

<H2>Performance of FIND server 29 May 91</H2>Conditions: Loops over   XFIND COPY TAPE CMS with SHOW DATE.  Normally
loaded machines (around 14:00) running VMS and accessing CRNVMC with
HTTP/TCP/IP.
<XMP>			Loops/min	Loops/sec
One process on one machine at a time:
	VXCRNA		27		.45 Hz
	ONLINE		27		.45 Hz

One process on each machine, all at the same time:
	VXCRNA		25		.4 Hz
	ONLINE		20
	VSOC28		18
	VSOC06		16
	Total		79		1.3 Hz

Thee spawned processes each machine, all the same time (12 in all):	
	VXCRNA		49		.4 Hz

	ONLINE		21

	VSOC28		20

	VSOC06		19

	Total		109		1.8 Hz

</XMP>The last test apparently brought the VM TCP interface close to running
out of buffers and losing telnet connections. This is with a version
of the daemon which incorrectly gives precedence to incoming new connections
over messages on existing connections, and so the number of connections
at any one time may have been larger than necessary. The test demonstrates
that the server (if not the IBM) behaves well under overload. The
throughput figure is sufficient for our <A NAME=5 HREF=../../Talks/FIND_problems.html#3>estimates</A> of peak load on
a running system.
<H2>From Feb 29 meeting:</H2>See browser outline <A NAME=1 HREF=../Browser.draw>module dependency diagram</A> we discussed.
<UL>
<LI>Does the Mac environment allow malloc()? If not, we have to make a
malloc().
<LI>Does a Mac socket() return something which can be used like a file?
Maybe anyway (for TWG) we have to make a HTStream macro a la NXStream.
The main operations on it would be block reads and writes.
<LI>The object-oriented parts of Think-C can't be used within hypercard.
This suggests use  c++ stand-alone on the Mac or we use just C all
over,  in OO style. An object which accepts the begin/end style, begin/end
anchor, and add text functions (methods)  seems to recur. Tim would
next time rewrite the Anchor handling with subclasses for parent and
child anchors.
<LI>We should get LaTeX manuals, to see about conversion.
<LI>We must look at Interviews and Andrew.
<LI>Should we make a portable text object?  If so, should we make it as
simple as possible, or make it a balanced/structured btree including
modification items and structured text?  Where do we draw the line?
We must take into account writing time, maintainability, execution
time (including program+data size which affects paging and is limited
on the Mac). We do not want  to reinvent the word processor....(<A NAME=3 HREF=#2> Note</A>
)
</UL><A NAME=2>I have since</A> come across many ways in which to have a tree in there
would be useful: for example, putting in hidden text, comments, and
things which we don't know how it interpret but we want to keep in
the file.
<H2>After meeting with Huettenberger from NeXT:</H2>we should combine the San Antonio meeting ith a visit to NeXT.<P>
Hot spots: if they are permanently visible, then that uses up a character
style, such as underlining, bodfacing etc. Whichever style is used,
this will at some point conflict with a style that already was used
in the document by its original author. Therefore: 
<UL>
<LI>make it an option/preference to see the hotspots permanently or not.
<LI>make it possible to see the hotspots only when holding down a command-key
or a mousebutton or some such combination.
</UL>What are the conditions for releasing W3 to academic NeXT users?
<H2>Meeting with L. Simoni (Bologna)</H2>do we have a server for VAX help libraries? how difficult is this?
