<H2>Format Handling</H2>In order to allow the daemon to tell the client the format of the
document that is being supplied, the daemon must itself be able to
recognise the format of local files.  This it currently does by examining
the "." extensions of a given file, and using a lookup table to find
out the name of the format which is implied by this extension.  The
format file is specified in the command line by the -f option.  The
file consists of sequence of lines of the form:
<XMP>FORMAT_NAME/FORMAT_PENALTY/FILE_EXTENSIONS/UNUSED/UNUSED

</XMP>An example is given below
<XMP>HTML//html//
PLAINTEXT//txt,DEFAULT//
POSTSCRIPT//ps//
TIFF//tiff//
GIF//gif//
COMPRESSED//Z//

</XMP>The FILE_EXTENSIONS entry is a comma separated list of extensions.
One of the formats may have the extension entry DEFAULT, which means
that this will be used if no others match.<P>
By default, if not format file is specified, only HTML and PLAINTEXT
are defined (with PLAINTEXT being the default).
<H2>Password Protection</H2>In addition to the rules file, the daemon now checks the access permissions
on the file before returning it.  Where global read is allowed, the
document is returned.<P>
On UNIX platforms, a check is carried out to see if the user ID and
password supplied by the client is valid on the host.  If they are,
the file must then either be owned by the user (and have read permission)
or the user must be a member of the group (and the group must have
read permission).  In either case the daemon must be run with an effective
UID of sufficient privilege to allow it to read the file.<P>
Normally the daemon would be run as user 'nobody', which has permission
only to read globally accessable files.  In the case where password
protection is being used, either the daemon must be run under a real
user ID which has access to all the files, or a dummy account must
be set up which has membership of the necessary groups.
<H2>Forwards, Redirections and Queries</H2>The updated protocol allows for a number of additional document types,
including forwards, redirections and queries.  Forwards tell the client
that the document has moved perminantly, implying that they should
update their links.  Redirections tell the client that the link from
the redirection changes periodically, so they should link to this
rather than the end document.  Queries contain the reference to a
query server and the text for that query.  When a client encounters
a query, it should never link to the query itself, only to the document
which references the query.<P>
If the server cannot find the desired document, it looks for files
with the same name, but the suffix '.f', '.r' or '.q'.  If it finds
any of these, it returns whatever is the contents of the file as the
new UDI.  Therefore to create a forward or redirection file, the '.f'
or '.r' file must only contain the new UDI.<P>
