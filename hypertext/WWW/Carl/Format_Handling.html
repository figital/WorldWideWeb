<H1>Format Handling</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>Format handling is the automatic manipulation of documents into a
format which can be output by the browser.  Where documents are sent
to the browser in a form it cannot directly display (i.e. in the HTML
language), they can be dealt with in threeways.  Either they can be
converted to HTML (or plain text), displayed by an external processing
agent, or placed in a file.
<H2>Format Preferences</H2>The preferences screen gives a list of acceptable formats which will
be sent to the server.  Each entry in the list is of the form:
<XMP>FORMAT_NAME/FORMAT_PENALTY/FILE_EXTENSIONS/PROCESSING_AGENT/CONVERSION_TO

</XMP>FORMAT_NAME is the name of the format, by which it is recognised when
sent from the server (e.g. POSTSCRIPT or HTML).<P>
 FORMAT_PENALTY is not used in the current implementation.<P>
 FILE_EXTENSIONS is a comma-separated list of '.' extensions by which
a file may be identified as being in that format.  One of the entries
in the list may be DEFAULT, which means that if no other extension
matches, this format is to be used instead.<P>
PROCESSING_AGENT is the agent which is responsible for the conversion.
This may have three values, INTERNAL, NONE, or a string.  INTERNAL
means that the processing of the format is done by the browser software
itself.  Currently if a format is declared to be INTERNAL, but is
not in HTML, will be treated as plain text.  NONE means that the browser
cannot handle the format, the entry is simply for information (to
know the file extension).  Where the entry is a string, it is taken
to be the name of the external program to be invoked.  Any external
processing agent must take it's input from the standard input (e.g.
crypt), and (where it is not a final format) should ouput to standard
output.  Note that on non-UNIX platforms this is not allowed (since
pipes are more difficult to implement). Instead, this is treated as
INTERNAL.<P>
CONVERSION_TO is the format to which this will be converted.  It may
either be another format in the list, ANY, if the format of the result
cannot be known in advance (e.g. uncompress), or a final format (SCREEN,
AUDIO, or FILE).  If a conversion is to produce user output and not
require further conversion, it should be marked as one of these two.
If the PROCESSING_AGENT is none, then no CONVERSTION_TO needs to be
specified.  If the CONVERSION_TO is FILE and the PROCESSING_AGENT
is INTERNAL, then the browser will request a file name and save the
data to this file.
<H2>Setting the Format Preferences</H2>The format preferences can only be set in one of two ways, either
by specifying them in the preferences file, or using the on-screen
preferences list.  Environment variables and command-line options
are not available.<P>
To change an existing entry using the on-screen list, type the number
letter combination followed by a space, then each entry in turn, separated
by a '/', e.g.
<XMP>7i GIF//gif/gifviewer/SCREEN
</XMP>To delete an entry, simply type the reference number (e.g. 7i).<P>
The format of the preferences file entry for the format list is:
<XMP>FORMATS=
   FORMAT_NAME/FORMAT_PENALTY/FILE_EXTENSION_LIST/PROCESSING_AGENT[/OUTPUT_FORMAT]
   FORMAT_NAME/FORMAT_PENALTY/FILE_EXTENSION_LIST/PROCESSING_AGENT[/OUTPUT_FORMAT]

	....


</XMP>where the first character of each line after the first is a tab.<P>
