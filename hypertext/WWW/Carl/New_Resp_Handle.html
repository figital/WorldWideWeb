<H1>Handling New Response Types</H1>The protocol which the browser uses to retrieve documents from a server
has been expanded to allow different types of repsonses, apart from
simple documents.  These responses include errors and forwards.<P>
An error is returned by a server if it encounters a situation it cannot
handle.  A forward is returned if the document requested no longer
exists at that location, and the server knows where the new location
is.<P>
When an error response is returned, the browser gives you the option
to CANCEL the request, in which the text returned in the message is
thrown away.  However, on some errors, and on all forwards, the browser
may also give you the option to PROCEED.  In the case of errors, PROCEEDing
tells the browser to attempt to reformulate the request in an attempt
to prevent the same error occuring.  This may mean requesting data,
such as passwords, from you.  In the case of forwards, the browser
sends the request to the new location.<P>
Where the PROCEED option is available, the browser can handle the
entire operation of <A NAME=1>retrying automatically</A> , if the preference AUTORETRY
is set to YES.  <P>
