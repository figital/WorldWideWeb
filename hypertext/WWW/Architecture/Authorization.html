<TITLE>Authorization -- /Architecture</TITLE>
<H1>Authorisaztion in the server</H1>The authorization for a HTTP file server running on a unix system
uses the underlying file protection scheme.<P>
The user and password registration tools are those of the system,
so two parallel systems do not have to learned by administrators.<P>
The daemon may be run under a non-root uid so that it is less prone
to pose a security problem due to an obscure programming bug.<P>
The daemon will therefore only have access to certain files by virtue
of the uid under which it runs.  This will provide a certain security.
<P>
The daemon will itself voluntarily refuse access if the rule file
denies access.<P>
The daemon is running in secure mode it will require a user/password
pair for any file which does not  have public read access.  It will
check that the password is valid, then that the relevant user would
have access to the file.  Therefore the file must be accessible by
BOTH the uid under which the daemon runs, and the authorized user.<P>
Authorized useds may be dummy (non login) users representing groups
of people.<P>
Administration<P>
Every class of user having privileged access will have to be given
a (dummy) user id on the system using the normal tools.<P>
Every set of documents requiring a different pattern of access rights
 should be given a corresponding groups id using the normal tools.<P>
The many-many mapping of groups to users (traditionally, in the "/etc/groups"
file) may be used to describe the mapping of the document sets onto
the dummy users.<P>
Browser<P>
The browser maintains a list of server/user/password for each protected
server that the user has accessed during the session. (Note that the
first access of a protected document must necessarily fail, and lead
the browser to putting up a panel requesting the user/password pair.
As one wants to send the user/password pair only to the correct server,
the browser should not be so constructed as to contain or ask for
the triples before actual access).tbl ctb rc
