<H1>Design Notes</H1>
<H2>From Feb 29 meeting:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Does the mac environment allow malloc()? If not, we have to make a
malloc().
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Does a Mac socket() return something which can be used like a file?
Maybe anyway (for TWG) we have to make a HTStream macro a la NXStream.
The operation on it would be block read and write.
<LI>The object-oriented parts of Think-C can't be used within hypercard.
This suggests use  c++ stand-alone on the Mac or we use just C all
over,  in OO style.
<LI>We should get LaTeX manuals, to see about conversion.
<LI>We must look at Interviews and Andrew.
<LI>Should we make a portable text object?  If so, should we make itas
simple as possible, or make it a balanced/structured btree including
modification items and structured text?  Where do we draw the line?
