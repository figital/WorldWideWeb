<H1>Installing WWW</H1>This section describes how to install the World-Wide Web<A NAME=1 HREF=QuickGuide.html> line-mode
browser</A> called "www". First of all,
<UL>
<LI>If you have a VAX/VMS machine, then see the <A NAME=4 HREF=Installation_VMS.html>special instuctions for
VMS</A> .
<LI>If you have not already got hold of the files, see the section on<A NAME=5 HREF=Distribution.html>
getting them</A> .
</UL>The browser has already been ported to VAX/Ultrix (using cc or gcc
compilers), VAX/VMS (read the <A NAME=2 HREF=Installation_VMS.html>special instructions</A> ), DECStation (MIPS),
Sun 3, Sun 4 (Sparc), NeXT, RS-6000, Apollo-M68K, HP-700 (Snake),
SGI, Convex, VM/CMS and MVS, IBM-PC/MS-DOS/PC-NFS, Macintosh. If your
machine is not one of those, see the section on <A NAME=7 HREF=Porting.html>porting</A> . If it is,
then find the relevant subdirectory of LineMode/Implementation.
<H2>Compiling</H2>This will not be necessary if there is already a copy of the executable
for your machine in the subdirectory. See <A NAME=14 HREF=MachineTypes.html>machine types</A> .
<UL>
<LI>Check the directory definitions in the Makefile in that subdirectory,
and change them if necessary. If the file www does not exist, type
"make".  See the definition of the macros in the file<A NAME=6 HREF=http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Implementation/CommonMakefile> Implementation/CommonMakefile</A>.
</UL>
<H2><A NAME=8>Installing</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>Become superuser (su root).  If you can't do this, see<A NAME=12 HREF=InstallNotSU.html> how to do it
without being superuser</A> ).
<LI>Type "make install". A reference copy of the executable is made and
copied into the system.
</UL>The "make install" step creates a copy in your system directories
of the www executable and the basic documenattion. If you wish to
just soft link them to the files on the WWW tree, say "make link"
instead. After either of these, "make clean" will remove intermediate
files.<P>
You must now check that the default "Home" page works, and<A NAME=13 HREF=Customisation.html> customize
it</A> if it is not what you want. The default home page is the CERN entry
point, which refers explicitly to certain information which we know
about. You may wish to add more.
<H2>Setting up news</H2>To read Internet news, you must have first defined the<A NAME=11 HREF=NewsServer.html> news server's
address</A> .
