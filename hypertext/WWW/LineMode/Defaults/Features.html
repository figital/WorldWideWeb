no -l logfileroot is specified.
</UL>
<H2>November 1991 version 0.14</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The `Recall' command now displays references as `R 1', `R 2', etc.
instead of just `1', `2', etc. so the user is reminded to type `R
&lt;number&gt;'.
<LI>An out-of-range reference number will launch a keyword search if applicable.
For instance, in the phone book, you can now type directly `3755'

<LI>Now treats '\r' characters as '\n' characters.

</UL>
<H2>July 91 version 0.10</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Bug fix for TOP commmand.  Now functions correctly, and data is only
buffered and formatted when the user requires more text,  hence saving
time.
<LI>Can pick up on the users home environment, to display a certain intial
page.  Set variable (on VMS, logical name) WWW_HOME to the full hypertext
of the file or index you want to start with.
<LI>Keyword search accepts longer strings.
<LI>On VMS, VMS files may be accessed. The WWW address is still unix-like,
with slashes, and is converted into VMS syntax by the browser.  VMS
users can now write their own hypertext and keep it on VMS, though
it will only be readable (at the moment) from VMS machines.
</UL>
<H2>June 91 version 0.9</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Bug fix in anonymous FTP. The first version with a-ftp access.

</UL>
<H2>21 May 91 version 0.7</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Parameters avaliable on the command line :-
</UL>
<DL>
<DT>-v
<DD> Shows trace comments, including the pathways taken to locate a
file.
<DT>-n
<DD> Makes the program non interactive with the user. No prompts are
shown, and after the node is displayed it exits the program  
<DT>-p
<DD> Turns off the paging. The page size can be selected by adding the
value immediately after the 'p'.  
<DT>-a
<DD> Stops positions of anchors being shown in the text.
</DL>

<UL>
<LI>These options are particulary useful when redirecting the input into
either a file or to the printer. They can also be used in any order
on the command line, as long as 'WWW' is the first arguement. 
<LI>When the recall command is used to view what files have been visited,
the titles of the files are used, rather than the file name. If there
is no title then the file name is used.
</UL>
<H2>14 May 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The function HTOpen() called from HTAccess has been changed so that
it takes two parameters instead of one. This extra one being a pointer
to an address where the format style is stored as an integer. The
translations of the integers to the formats can be seen in WWW.h.
At the momment this extra parameter is not used but will be in the
near future so that more files can be accessed.
</UL>
<H2>10 May 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>WWW now reads the formatted text into a double linked buffer one screen
full at a time and then produces it on the screen. This enables checking
of documents so that splitting of small paragraphs or titles does
not occur at the bottom of the screen. 
<LI>An option is offered to return to the top of the present document
being viewed.
<LI>Tim added the necessary code so that WWW can now access remote files
using anonymous FTP.
</UL>
<H2>17 April 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Modified WWW so that it is also executable on the SUN machines., i.e.
using ordinary C.
<LI>First version realeased on PRIAM, for testing by a few users, to gain
feedback.
<LI>Accepts keywords with the execute command. 
</UL>
<H2>8 April 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Keywords can be entered on the command line.
<LI>The input file is copied into a buffer as soon as it is opened, so
that the input channel is closed as soon as possible and the server
freed. The first 23 lines of the document are read into the buffer
and produced onto the screen. As soon as this is done, the remaining
file is read into the buffer so the input channel is closed. 
</UL>
<H2>7 March 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Created an array called 'string_space' which is filled with blank
spaces to be used for printing out margins etc. This method of printing
a string was found to be faster than individually printing spaces.
<LI>A history mechanism has been included so that a list of all the documents
viewed are stored so that the user can refer  back to them using the
BACK, HOME and RECALL commands.
<LI>Changed code so that the browser can handle text which contains long
words which exceed the allowed line length on their own. This is just
done by continuing the word on the following line.
<LI>Read titles and headings into a buffer before outputting so that in
cases where the title has a word longer than the allowed line length
can be dealt with (for example above).This could also be useful in
helping to solve the above problem. Maybe extend the length of headings.
</UL>
<H2>5 March 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Handles a  "LISTING" tag by treating it in the same way as an "XMP"
tag. This is because, in the case of the line mode browser, the screen
is limited to 80 columns and so the browser is unable to work with
the 132 columns which the "LISTING" tag normally expects.
<LI>Handles an "ADDRESS" tag, which left justifies the text.
</UL>
<H2>27 Feb 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Lists and the help menu are not so spread out, as before.
<LI>The browser works with file numbers rather than the file pointers.
<LI>Tidied up paging, with the last line of a page repeated at top of
next.
<LI>Deals with tags within anchors.
</UL>
<H2>11 Feb 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>HTTP access to cernvm server, including FIND and NEWS tested.
<LI>Browser can be executed by 'WWW' , 'YP' (yellow pages), 'XNEWS', or
'FIND'.
<LI>"PLAINTEXT" tag added. Prints out the node exactly as it finds it
in the file.
<LI>Prompt only contains appropriate options, as does the help message.
<LI>Keyword search option added.
</UL>
<H2>Before Feb 91</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Text formatting and line wrapping completed to a reasonable standard.
<LI>Removed section of program where 'r' has to be entered in order to
select a reference.  
<LI>When no hypertext references have been found, the browser informs
the user, and doesn't offer the list option in the help menu.   
<LI>Produces an error message if the user tries to select a reference
or menu, when no references have been found.
<LI>Records whether an anchor is a NAME or an HREF.    
<LI>Stop **** END **** (now [End]) appearing in the wrong places. This
problem appears due to the lines in the html file being too long,
so this causes an error in the 'C' run time.
<LI>Handles a glossary.
