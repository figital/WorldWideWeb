<NEXTID 1>
<H1>Your login script</H1>Under unix, when you start your shell, a login script is executed.
Use the manual page for your shell to find out more about this.  If
you are using csh, then files .login and .cshrc in your home directory
are both executed.<P>
[Remember that ls -a displays also filenames which start with a dot,
whereas ls normally hides them...]</A>
