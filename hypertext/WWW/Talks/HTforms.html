<H1>Forms of Hypertext</H1>Best known form is that of nodes of information linked together by
specific links. This set of nodes and their links form a "web". It
is the most general form.  There are other forms of links:
<DL>
<DT>Indexes
<DD>an index is kept (or built) for a large set of similar material
(eg. documentation in FIND on VM). Links are followed from the index
into the material by giving keyword(s).
<DT>Dynamic links
<DD>Links are built "on the fly" by interpreting the structure
of the material. Eg. the presentation of mail and news messages, where
the list of messages is used as a list of anchors.
<DT>Knowbots
<DD>a query is stated, and some active process tries to find the
answer by examining the contents of nodes. This is a generalisation
of databases. Searches can take a very long time.
