<H2>Technical:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>There may be (in <A NAME=4 HREF=../People.html#Pollermann>my</A> opinion) a problem concerning the access frequency.<A NAME=3>
Worst case</A> on VM alone: 1 call/second at peak time.

<H2>Data:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Larger documents: we have no technical writer
<LI>INFOS: People (e.g. User's office) don't provide them.
<LI>WHO: No phone numbers for technical staff from vendors: any hope?
<LI>YELLOW:  limited collaboration from the secretariats. Most of them
have a "friendly" attitude, so a meeting which I will try to organize
with them may help.
