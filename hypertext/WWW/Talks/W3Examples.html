<title>W3 examples for talk</title>
<h1>Examples in the web</h1>
This is a set of pointers to things which it is useful to demonstrate.
Note restrictions of demo: Font size has been changed
where possible for visibility,
so less information fits on each per screen.
(<a href=Overview.html>list of talks</a>).
<p>
As an example of an organisation "Welcome" page, look at
<a href=http://info.cern.ch/>CERN</a> :-).
<p>
As examples of different types of data displayed as hypertext,
look at the
<a href=news:alt.hypertext>alt.hypertext</a> newsgroup,
an <a href=file://export.lcs.mit.edu/>FTP site</a>
(not possible at PARC because
of in.gateway), a 
<a href=gopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu/>"gopher"</a> server,...
<h2>Index searches</h2>
Let's look at
a WAIS server for
<a href=http://info.cern.ch:8001/microworld.media.mit.edu:8000/POETRY?
>poetry</a>.
<p>
We can search that server, and having got back a hit list, make
an explicit link to the <a href=http://info.cern.ch:8001/microworld.media.mit.edu:8000/POETRY?cloths+heaven>search result</a>.
<p>
We can similarly make a link to a <a href= http://info.cern.ch:8001/microworld.media.mit.edu:8000/POETRY/TEXT/446/2=/home/microworld/uriw/wais-b3/wais-sources/POETRY;3=837134%20837580%20/Library/Poetry/bialik/all-dashed-text;7=%00;>chosen document</a>.
This demonstrates the consistent rule that anything which you can access you can link to, or quote by reference.
<p>Another example is the CERN
<a href= http://crnvmc.cern.ch./WHO>phone book</a> which has links and is
searchable.
