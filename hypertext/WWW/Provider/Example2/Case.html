<H1>The multiple selection</H1>Here's an example of a <A NAME=1 HREF=../RadioButtons.html>multiple selection</A> problem from Gary S. Wagman.
<XMP>> So here's my dynamic list situation: The user
> chooses option PARTICLE. Then chooses EASY. A list is presented that looks
> like:
> 
> Press "X" to select; "H" for help.
> 
> _  GAUGE AND HIGGS BOSONS
> _  LIGHT UNFLAVORED MESONS
> _  OTHER LIGHT UNFLAVORED MESONS
> _  STRANGE MESONS
> _  CHARMED MESONS
> _  CHARMED STRANGE MESONS
> _  BOTTOM MESONS
> _  b bbar MESONS
> _  NON-q qbar CANDIDATES
> _  HEAVY QUARK SEARCHES
> _  N BARYONS
> _  Delta BARYONS
> _  Lambda BARYONS
> _  Sigma BARYONS
> _  Xi BARYONS
> _  Omega BARYONS
> _  CHARMED BARYONS
> _  BOTTOM (BEAUTY) BARYON
> _  SEARCHES FOR FREE QUARKS, MONOPOLES, SUPERSYMMETRY, COMPOSITENESS, ETC.
> 
> 
> Suppose they then put an X in Omega BARYONS and BOTTOM (BEAUTY) BARYON. The
> user then sees:
> 
> Press "X" to select; "H" for help.
> 
> _  Omega-
> _  Omega(2250)-
> _  Omega(2380)-
> _  Omega(2470)-
> _  Lambda(b)0
> 
> Suppose they next put an X in Omega- and Lambda(b)0, they now get another
> menu:
> 
> Use up/down arrows to move the cursor; RETURN key to select; "H" key for help.
> 
> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FROM THE PARTICLE(S) YOU HAVE SELECTED?
> 
> ALL         The complete Full Listings for the particle(s) selected.
> HEADER      Particle name, quantum numbers, and general comments.
> DECAYS      Decay modes, constrained fit information, and fit correlation
>             matrices.
> REFERENCES  Publication names, authors, institutions, and reported quantum
>             numbers.
> PROPERTY    To select particular properties from particles already selected
>             (e.g. some mass(es), some branching ratio(s), etc.).
> CLASS       To select properties by class (e.g. the mass, the decay
>             parameters, etc. in all particles already selected).
> 
> 
> PREVIOUS    To return to the previous menu. (PF3)
> EXIT        To leave this program. (PF4)
> 
> When they make a selection from this menu, the program queries based on the
> MULTIPLE particles that may have been chosen. From what I remember seeing in
> WWW, multiple choices are made be typing in item numbers. For a lot of
> particles (which may have been shown on many previous screens to which they
> cannot scroll backwards), the user would tediously have to type in a lot of
> numbers. (Actually, my program runs in this "tedious mode" for users on really
> DUMB terminals.) In VT-mode, my users just type an "X" for the items they want
> and can scroll forward and backward.
