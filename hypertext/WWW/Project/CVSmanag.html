DESCRIPTION cvs is a system for providing source control to hierarchical
collections of source directories. Commands and procedures for using
cvs are described in cvs(1).<P>
 cvs manages source repositories, the directories containing master
copies of the revision-controlled files, by copying particular revisions
of the files to (and modifications back from) developers' private
working directories. In terms of file structure, each individual source
repository is an immediate subdirectory of $CVSROOT.<P>
 The files described here are supporting files; they do not have to
exist for cvs to operate, but they allow you to make cvs operation
more flexible.<P>
 The cvsinit(1) shell script included at the top-level of the cvs
distribution can be used to setup an initial $CVSROOT/CVSROOT area,
if you don't have one already.<P>
 You can use the 'modules' file to define symbolic names for collections
of source maintained with cvs. If there is no 'modules' file, developers
must specify complete path names (absolute, or relative to $CVSROOT)
for the files they wish to manage with cvs commands.<P>
 You can use the 'commitinfo' file to define programs to execute whenever
'cvs commit' is about to execute. These programs are used for ''pre-commit''
checking to verify that the modified, added, and removed files are
really ready to be committed. Some uses for this check might be to
turn off a portion (or all) of the source repository from a particular
person or group. Or, perhaps, to verify that the changed files conform
to the site's standards for coding practice.<P>
 You can use the 'loginfo' file to define programs to execute after
any commit, which writes a log entry for changes in the repository.
These logging programs might be used to append the log message to
a file. Or send the log message through electronic mail to a group
of developers. Or, perhaps, post the log message to a particular newsgroup.<P>
 You can use the 'rcsinfo' file to define forms for log messages.<P>
 You can use the 'editinfo' file to define a program to execute for
editing/validating 'cvs commit' log entries. This is most useful when
used with a 'rcsinfo' forms specification, as it can verify that the
proper fields of the form have been filled in by the user committing
the change.<P>
 You can use the 'cvsignore' file to specify the default list of files
to ignore during update.<P>
 You can use the 'history' file to record the cvs commands that affect
the repository. The creation of this file enables history logging.<P>
FILES modules The 'modules' file records your definitions of names
for collections of source code. cvs will use these definitions if
you create a file with the right format in '$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules,v'.
The mkmodules(1) command should be run whenever the modules file changes,
so that the appropriate files can be generated (depending on how you
have configured cvs operation).<P>
 To allow convenient editing of the 'modules' file itself, the file
should include an entry like the following (where localbin represents
the directory where your site installs programs like mkmodules(1)):<P>
 modules -i /localbin/mkmodules CVSROOT modules<P>
 This defines the name 'modules' as the module name for the file itself,
so that you can use<P>
 example% cvs checkout modules<P>
 to get an editable copy of the file. You should define similar module
entries for the other configuration files described here (except 'history').
The cvsinit(1) script will setup a smilar 'modules' file for you automatically.<P>
 The 'modules' file may contain blank lines and comments (lines beginning
with '#') as well as module definitions. Long lines can be continued
on the next line by specifying a backslash (''\'') as the last character
on the line.<P>
 A module definition is a single line of the 'modules' file, in either
of two formats. In both cases, mname represents the symbolic module
name, and the remainder of the line is its definition.<P>
 mname -a aliases... This represents the simplest way of defining
a module mname. The '-a' flags the definition as a simple alias: cvs
will treat any use of mname (as a command argument) as if the list
of names aliases had been specified instead. aliases may contain either
other module names or paths. When you use paths in aliases, 'cvs checkout'
creates all intermediate directories in the working directory, just
as if the path had been specified explicitly in the cvs arguments.<P>
 mname [ options ] dir [ files... ] [ &module... ]<P>
 In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to 'mname
dir'. This defines all the files in directory dir as module mname.
dir is a relative path (from $CVSROOT) to a directory of source in
one of the source repositories. In this case, on checkout, a single
directory called mname is created as a working directory; no intermediate
directory levels are used by default, even if dir was a path involving
several directory levels.<P>
 By explicitly specifying files in the module definition after dir,
you can select particular files from directory dir. The sample definition
for modules is an example of a module defined with a single file from
a particular directory. Here is another example:<P>
 m4test unsupported/gnu/m4 foreach.m4 forloop.m4<P>
 With this definition, executing 'cvs checkout m4test' will create
a single working directory 'm4test' containing the two files listed,
which both come from a common directory several levels deep in the
cvs source repository.<P>
 A module definition can refer to other modules by including '&module'
in its definition. checkout creates a subdirectory for each such module,
in your working directory. New in cvs 1.3; avoid this feature if sharing
module definitions with older versions of cvs.<P>
 Finally, you can use one or more of the following options in module
definitions:<P>
 '-d name', to name the working directory something other than the
module name. New in cvs 1.3; avoid this feature if sharing module
definitions with older versions of cvs.<P>
 '-i prog' allows you to specify a program prog to run whenever files
in a module are committed. prog runs with a single argument, the full
pathname of the affected directory in a source repository. The 'commitinfo',
'loginfo', and 'editinfo' files provide other ways to call a program
on commit.<P>
 '-o prog' allows you to specify a program prog to run whenever files
in a module are checked out. prog runs with a single argument, the
module name.<P>
 '-t prog' allows you to specify a program prog to run whenever files
in a module are tagged. prog runs with two arguments: the module name
and the symbolic tag specified to rtag.<P>
 '-u prog' allows you to specify a program prog to run whenever 'cvs
update' is executed from the top-level directory of the checked-out
module. prog runs with a single argument, the full path to the source
repository for this module.<P>
 commitinfo, loginfo, rcsinfo, editinfo These files all specify programs
to call at different points in the 'cvs commit' process. They have
a common structure. Each line is a pair of fields: a regular expression,
separated by whitespace from a filename or command-line template.
Whenever one of the regular expression matches a directory name in
the repository, the rest of the line is used. If the line begins with
a # character, the entire line is considered a comment and is ignored.
Whitespace between the fields is also ignored.<P>
 For 'loginfo', the rest of the line is a command-line template to
execute. The templates can include not only a program name, but whatever
list of arguments you wish. If you write '%s' somewhere on the argument
list, cvs supplies, at that point, the list of files affected by the
commit. The first entry in the list is the relative path within the
source repository where the change is being made. The remaining arguments
list the files that are being modified, added, or removed by this
commit invocation.<P>
 For 'commitinfo', the rest of the line is a commandline template
to execute. The template can include can include not only a program
name, but whatever list of arguments you wish. The full path to the
current source repository is appended to the template, followed by
the file names of any files involved in the commit (added, removed,
and modified files).<P>
 For 'rcsinfo', the rest of the line is the full path to a file that
should be loaded into the log message template.<P>
 For 'editinfo', the rest of the line is a command-line template to
execute. The template can include not only a program name, but whatever
list of arguments you wish. The full path to the current log message
template file is appended to the template.<P>
 You can use one of two special strings instead of a regular expression:
'ALL' specifies a command line template that must always be executed,
and 'DEFAULT' specifies a command line template to use if no regular
expression is a match.<P>
 The 'commitinfo' file contains commands to execute before any other
commit activity, to allow you to check any conditions that must be
satisfied before commit can proceed. The rest of the commit will execute
only if all selected commands from this file exit with exit status
0.<P>
 The 'rcsinfo' file allows you to specify log templates for the commit
logging session; you can use this to provide a form to edit when filling
out the commit log. The field after the regular expression, in this
file, contains filenames (of files containing the logging forms) rather
than command templates.<P>
 The 'editinfo' file allows you to execute a script before the commit
starts, but after the log information is recorded. These "edit" scripts
can verify information recorded in the log file. If the edit script
exits wth a non-zero exit status, the commit is aborted.<P>
 The 'loginfo' file contains commands to execute at the end of a commit.
The text specified as a commit log message is piped through the command;
typical uses include sending mail, filing an article in a newsgroup,
or appending to a central file.<P>
 cvsignore, .cvsignore The default list of files (or sh(1) file name
patterns) to ignore during 'cvs update'. At startup time, cvs loads
the compiled in default list of file name patterns (see cvs(1)). Then
the per-repository list included in $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore is
loaded, if it exists. Then the per-user list is loaded from '$HOME/.cvsignore'.
Finally, as cvs traverses through your directories, it will load any
per-directory '.cvsignore' files whenever it finds one. These perdirectory
files are only valid for exactly the directory that contains them,
not for any sub-directories.<P>
history Create this file in $CVSROOT/CVSROOT to enable history logging
(see the description of 'cvs history').<P>
