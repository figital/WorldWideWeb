<H1>import [ options] repository vendortag releasetag...</H1>Requires:	Repository, source distribution directory<P>
Changes:	repository.<P>
Use 'cvs import' to incorporate an entire source distribution from
an outside source (e.g., a source vendor) into your source repository
directory. You can use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module form the outside
source.<P>
The repository argument gives a directory name (or a path to a directory)
under the CVS root directory for repositories; if the directory did
not exist, import creates it.<P>
When you use import for updates to source that has been modified in
your source repository (since a prior import), it will notify you
of any files that conflict in the two branches of development; use
'cvs checkout j' to reconcile the differences, as import instructs
you to do.<P>
By default, certain file names are ignored during 'cvs import':	names
associated with CVS administration, or with other common source control
systems; common names for patch files, object files, archive files,
and editor backup files; and other names that are usually artifacts
of assorted utilities. Currently, the default list of ignored files
includes files matching these names:<P>
RCSLOG RCS SCCS<P>
CVS* cvslog.*<P>
tags TAGS<P>
*~ #* .#* ,*<P>
*.old *.bak *.orig *.rej .del *<P>
*.a *.o *.Z *.elc *.ln core<P>
The outside source is saved in a first level RCS branch, by default
'1.1.1'. Updates are leaves of this branch; for example, files from
the first imported collection of source will be revision '1.1.1.1',
then files from the first imported update will be revision '1.1.1.2',
and so on.<P>
At least three arguments are required. repository is needed to identify
the collection of source. vendor tag is a tag for the entire branch
(e.g., for '1.1.1'). You must also specify at least one release tag
to identify the files at the leaves created each time you execute
'cvs import'.<P>
Three of the standard cvs command options are available:	Q, -q, and
-m message. If you do not specify  logging message with -m, your editor
is invoked (as with commit) to allow you to enter one.<P>
There are two additional special options.<P>
Use ' b branch' to specify a first level branch other than '1.1.1'.<P>
Use ' I name' to specify file names that should be ignored during
import. You can use this option repeatedly. To avoid ignoring any
files at all (even those ignored by default), specify ' I !'.
