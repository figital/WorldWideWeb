<TITLE>CVSstatus -- /Project</TITLE>
<NEXTID 1>
<H1>status [ lR] [ v] [files...]</H1>Requires:	working directory, repository<P>
Changes:	nothing.<P>
Display a brief report on the current status of files with respect
to the source repository, including any "sticky" tags, dates, or -k
options. ("Sticky" options will restrict how 'cvs update' operates
until you reset them; see the description of 'cvs update A...'.)<P>
You can also use this command to anticipate the potential impact of
a 'cvs update' on your working source directory. If you do not specify
any files explicitly, reports are shown for all files that cvs has
placed in your working directory. You can limit the scope of this
search to the current directory itself (not its subdirectories) with
the standard -l option flag; or you can explicitly request recursive
status reports with the -R option.<P>
The -v option causes the symbolic tags for the RCS fileto be displayed
as well.
