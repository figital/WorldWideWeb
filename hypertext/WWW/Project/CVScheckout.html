Make a working directory containing copies of the source files specified
by modules. You must execute 'cvs checkout' before using most of the
other cvs commands, since most of them operate on your working directory.<P>
Modules are either symbolic names (themselves defined as the module
'modules' in the source repository; see cvs(5)) for some collection
of source directories and files, or paths to directories or files
in the repository.<P>
Depending on the modules you specify, checkout may recursively create
directories and populate them with the appropriate source files. You
can then edit these source files at any time (regardless of whether
other software developers are editing their own copies of the sources);
update them to include new changes applied by others to the source
repository; or commit your work as a permanent change to the RCS repository.<P>
Note that checkout is used to create directories. The toplevel directory
created is always added to the directory where checkout is invoked,
and usually has the same name as the specified module. In the case
of a module alias, the created subdirectory may have a different name,
but you can be sure that it will be a subdirectory, and that checkout
will show the relative path leading to each file as it is extracted
into your private work area (unless you specify the -Q option).<P>
Running 'cvs checkout' on a directory that was already built by a
prior checkout is also permitted, and has the same effect as specifying
the -d option to the update command described below.<P>
The options permitted with 'cvs checkout' include the standard command
options  P, -Q, -f, -k kflag , -l, -n, p, -q, -r tag, and  D date.<P>
In addition to those, you can use these special command options with
checkout:<P>
Use the -A option to reset any sticky tags, dates, or k options.
(If you get a working file using one ofthe -r, -D, or -k options,
cvs remembers thecorresponding tag, date, or kflag and continues using
it on future updates; use the -A option to make cvs forget these specifications,
and retrieve the "head" version of the file).<P>
The -j branch option merges the changes made between the resulting
revision and the revision that it is based on (e.g., if the tag refers
to a branch, cvs will merge all changes made in that branch into your
working file).<P>
With two -j options, cvs will merge in the changes between the two
respective revisions. This can be used to "remove" a certain delta
from your working file.<P>
In addition, each -j option can contain on optional date specification
which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen revision to one
within a specific date. An optional date is specified by adding a
colon (:) to the tag. An example might be what 'cvs import' tells
you to do when you have just imported sources that have conflicts
with local changes:<P>
cvs checkout -jTAG:yesterday -jTAG module<P>
Use the -N option with ' d dir' to avoid shortening module paths
in your working directory. (Normally, cvs shortens paths as much as
possible when you specify an explicit target directory.)<P>
Use the -c option to copy the module file, sorted, to the standard
output, instead of creating or modifying any files or directories
in your working directory.<P>
Use the -d dir option to create a directory called dir for the working
files, instead of using the module name. Unless you also use -N, the
paths created under dir will be as short as possible.<P>
Use the -s option to display per module status information stored
with the -s option within the modules file.
