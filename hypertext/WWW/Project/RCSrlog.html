<NEXTID 1>rlog - print log messages and other information about RCS files
<H1></H1>Synopsis<P>
rlog [ options ] file ...<P>
Description<P>
Rlog prints information about RCS files. Files ending in ',v' are
RCS files, all others are working files. If a working file is given,
rlog tries to find the corresponding RCS file first in directory ./RCS
and then in the current directory, as explained in co(1L).<P>
Rlog prints the following information for each RCS file: RCS file
name, working file name, head (i.e., the number of the latest revision
on the trunk), default branch, access list, locks, symbolic names,
suffix, total number of revisions, number of revisions selected for
printing, and descriptive text. This is followed by entries for the
selected revisions in reverse chronological order for each branch.
For each revision, rlog prints revision number, author, date/time,
state, number of lines added/deleted (with respect to the previous
revision), locker of the revision (if any), and log message. Without
options, rlog prints complete information. The options below restrict
this output.<P>
-L	ignores files with no locks set; convenient in combination with
-R,-h, or -l.<P>
-R	only prints the name of the RCS file; convenient for translating
a working file name into an RCS file name.<P>
-h	prints only RCS file name, working file name, head, default branch,
access list, locks, symbolic names, and suffix.<P>
-t	prints the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.<P>
-b	prints information about the revisions on the default branch (normally
the highest branch on the trunk).<P>
-ddates	prints information about revisions with a checkin date/time
in the ranges given by the semicolon-separated list of dates. A range
d1<d2 or d2>d1 selects the revisions that were deposited between d1
and d2, (inclusive). A range  <d or d> selects all revisions dated
d or earlier. A range  d< or >d selects all revisions dated d or later.
A range  d selects the single, latest revision dated d or earlier.
The date/time strings d, d1, and d2 are in the free format explained
in co(1L). Quoting is normally necessary, especially for < and >.
The separator is ';'.<P>
-l[lockers]	prints information about locked revisions. If the comma-separated
list lockers of login names is given, only the revisions locked by
the given login names are printed. If the list is omitted, all locked
revisions are printed.<P>
-rrevisions	prints information about revisions given in the comma-separated
list revisions of revisions and ranges. A range rev1-rev2 means revisions
rev1 to rev2 on the same branch, -rev means revisions from the beginning
of the branch up to and including rev, and revmeans revisions starting
with rev to the end of the branch containing rev. An argument that
is a branch means all revisions on that branch. A range of branches
means all revisions on the branches in that range.<P>
-sstates	prints information about revisions whose state attributes
match one of the states given in the comma-separated list states.<P>
-w[logins]	prints information about revisions checked in by users with
login names appearing in the comma-separated list logins. If logins
is omitted, the user's login is assumed.<P>
Rlog prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the options
-d, -l, -s, -w, intersected with the union of the revisions selected
by -b and -r.<P>
Examples<P>
rlog -L -R RCS/*,v <P>
rlog -L -h RCS/*,v <P>
rlog -L -l RCS/*,v <P>
rlog RCS/*,v<P>
The first command prints the names of all RCS files in the subdirectory
'RCS' which have locks. The second command prints the headers of those
files, and the third prints the headers plus the log messages of the
locked revisions. The last command prints complete information.<P>
Diagnostics<P>
The exit status always refers to the last RCS file operated upon,
and is 0 if the operation was successful, 1 otherwise.
