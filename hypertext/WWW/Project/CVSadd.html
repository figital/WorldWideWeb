Use the add command to create a new file or directory in the RCS source
repository. The files or directories specified with add must already
exist in the current directory (which must have been created with
the checkout command). To add a whole new directory hierarchy to the
source repository (for example, files received from a third party
vendor), use the 'cvs import' command instead.<P>
If the argument to 'cvs add' refers to an immediate subdirectory,
the directory is created at the correct place in the RCS source repository,
and the necessary cvs administration files are created in your working
directory. If the directory already exists in the source repository,
'cvs add' still creates the administration files in your version of
the directory. This allows you to use 'cvs add' to add a particular
directory to your private sources even if someone else created that
directory after your checkout of the sources. You can do the following:<P>
mkdir new_director<P>
cvs add new_directory<P>
cvs update new_directory<P>
An alternate approach using 'cvs update' might be:<P>
cvs update -d new_director<P>
(To add any available new directories to your working directory, it's
probably simpler to use 'cvs checkout' or 'cvs update -d'.)<P>
The added files are not placed in the RCS source repository until
you use 'cvs commit' to make the change permanent. Doing a 'cvs add'
on a file that was removed with the 'cvs remove' command will resurrect
the file, if no 'cvs commit' command intervened.<P>
You will have the opportunity to specify a logging message, as usual,
when you use 'cvs commit' to make the new file permanent. If you'd
like to have another logging message associated with just creation
of the file (for example, to describe the file's purpose), you can
specify it with the ' m message' option to the add command.<P>
The ' k kflag' option specifies the default way that this file will
be checked out. The 'kflag' argument isstored in the RCS file and
can be changed with 'cvsadmin'. Specifying ' ko' is useful for checking
in binaries that shouldn't have the RCS id strings expanded.<A NAME=0 HREF=http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/People.html#Cailliau> RC</A>
