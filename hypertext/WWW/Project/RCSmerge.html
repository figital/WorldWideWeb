<NEXTID 1>rcsmerge - merge RCS revisions
<H1></H1>Synopsis<P>
rcsmerge -rrev1 [ -rrev2 ] [ -p ] file<P>
Description<P>
Rcsmerge incorporates the changes between rev1 and rev2 of an RCS
file into the corresponding working file. If -p is given, the result
is printed on the standard output, otherwise the result overwrites
the working file.<P>
A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name, otherwise a working
file name. Merge derives the working file name from the RCS file name
and vice versa, as explained in co(1L). A pair consisting of both
an RCS and a working file name may also be specified.<P>
Rev1 may not be omitted. If rev2 is omitted, the latest revision on
the default branch (normally the highest branch on the trunk) is assumed.
Both rev1 and rev2 may be given numerically or symbolically.<P>
Rcsmerge prints a warning if there are overlaps, and delimits the
overlapping regions as explained in co -j. The command is useful for
incorporating changes into a checked-out revision.<P>
Examples<P>
Suppose you have released revision 2.8 of f.c. Assume furthermore
that you just completed revision 3.4, when you receive updates to
release 2.8 from someone else. To combine the updates to 2.8 and your
changes between 2.8 and 3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c
and execute<P>
rcsmerge -p -r2.8 -r3.4 f.c >f.merged.c<P>
Then examine f.merged.c. Alternatively, if you want to save the updates
to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as revision 2.8.1.1 and execute
co -j:<P>
ci -r2.8.1.1 f.c<P>
co -r3.4 -j2.8:2.8.1.1 f.c<P>
As another example, the following command undoes the changes between
revision 2.4 and 2.8 in your currently checked out revision in f.c.<P>
rcsmerge -r2.8 -r2.4 f.c<P>
Note the order of the arguments, and that f.c will be overwritten.<P>
Bugs<P>
Rcsmerge does not work on files that contain lines with a single '.'.
