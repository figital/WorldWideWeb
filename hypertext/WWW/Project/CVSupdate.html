<H1>update [ AdflPpQqR] [ d] [ r tag| D date] files...</H1>Requires:	repository, working directory<P>
Changes:	working directory<P>
After you've run checkout to create your private copy of source from
the common repository, other developers will continue changing the
central source. From time to time, when it is convenient in your development
process, you can use the update command from within your working directory
to reconcile your work with any revisions applied to the source repository
since your last checkout or update.<P>
update keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line for each
file, prefaced with one of the characters 'U A R M C ?' to indicate
the status of the file:<P>
U file	The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.
This is done for any file that exists in the repository but not in
your source, and for files that you haven't changed but are not the
most recent versions available in the repository.<P>
A file	The file has been added to your private copy of the sources,
and will be added to the RCS source repository when you run 'cvs commit'
on the file. This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.<P>
R file	The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources,
and will be removed from the RCS source repository when you run 'cvs
commit' on the file. This is a reminder to you that the file needs
to be committed.<P>
M file	The file is modified in your working directory. 'M' can indicate
one of two states for a file you're working on: either there were
no modifications to the same file in the repository, so that your
file remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications in the
repository as well as in your copy, but they were merged successfully,
without conflict, in your working directory.<P>
C file	A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to
file with changes from the source repository. file (the copy in your
working directory) is now the output of the rcsmerge(1) command on
the two versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your
working directory, with the name '.#file.version', where version is
the RCS revision that your modified file started from. (Note that
some systems automatically purge files that begin with '.#' if they
have not been accessed for a few days. If you intend to keep a copy
of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename it.)<P>
? file	file is in your working directory, but does not correspond to
anything in the source repository, and is not in the list of files
for cvs to ignore (see the description of the -I option).<P>
Use the -A option to reset any sticky tags, dates, or k options.
(If you get a working copy of a file by using one of the -r, -D, or
-k options, cvs remembers the corresponding tag, date, or kflag and
continues using it on future updates; use the -A option to make cvs
forget these specifications, and retrieve the "head" version of the
file).<P>
The -j branch option merges the changes made between the resulting
revision and the revision that it is based on (e.g., if the tag refers
to a branch, cvs will merge all changes made in that branch into your
working file).<P>
With two -j options, cvs will merge in the changes between the two
respective revisions. This can be used to "remove" a certain delta
from your working file. E.g., if the file foo.c is based on revision
1.6 and I want to remove the changes made between 1.3 and 1.5, I might
do:<P>
cvs update -j1.5 -j1.3 foo.c # note the order..<P>
In addition, each -j option can contain on optionaldate specification
which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen revision to one
within a specific date. An optional date is specified by adding a
colon (:) to the tag.<P>
jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier<P>
Use the -d option to create any directories that exist in the repository
if they're missing from the working directory. (Normally, update acts
only on directories and files that were already enrolled in your working
directory.) This is useful for updating directories that were created
in the repository since the initial checkout; but it has an unfortunate
side effect. If you deliberately avoided certain directories in the
repository when you created your working directory (either through
use of a module name or by listing explicitly the files and directories
you wanted on the command line), then updating with -d will create
those directories, which may not be what you want.<P>
Use -IÊname to ignore files whose names match name (in your working
directory) during the update. You can specify -I more than once on
the command line to specify several files to ignore. By default, update
ignores files whose names match any of the following:<P>
RCSLOG RCS SCCS<P>
CVS* cvslog.*<P>
tags TAGS<P>
*~ #* .#* ,*<P>
*.old *.bak *.orig *.rej .del *<P>
*.a *.o *.Z *.elc *.ln core<P>
Use ' I !' to avoid ignoring any files at all.<P>
The standard cvs command options -f, -k, -l, -P, -p, Q, -q, and -r
are also available with update.
