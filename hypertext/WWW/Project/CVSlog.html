Display log information for files. 'cvs log' calls the RCS utility
rlog; all the options described in rlog(1)are available. Among the
more useful rlog options are h to display only the header (including
tag definitions, but omitting most of the full log); -r to select
logs on particular revisions or ranges of revisions; and -d to select
particular dates or date ranges. See rlog(1) for full explanations.
This command is recursive by default, unless the -l option is specified.
