<NEXTID 1>Environment Variables
<H1></H1>CVSROOT	Should contain the full pathname to the root of the cvs source
repository (where the RCS files are kept). This information must be
available to cvs for most commands to execute; if CVSROOT is not set,
or if you wish to override it for one invocation, you can supply it
on the command line:	'cvs -d cvsroot cvs_command...'<P>
	You may not need to set CVSROOT if your cvs binary has the right path
compiled in; use 'cvs -v' to display all compiledin paths.<P>
CVSREAD	If this is set, checkout and update will try hard to make the
files in your working directory readonly. When this is not set, the
default behavior is to permit modification of your working files.<P>
RCSBIN	Specifies the full pathname where to find RCS programs,such
as co(1) and ci(1). If not set, a compiledinvalue is used; see the
display from 'cvs -v'.<P>
EDITOR	Specifies the program to use for recording log messages during
commit. If not set, the default is /usr/ucb/vi.
