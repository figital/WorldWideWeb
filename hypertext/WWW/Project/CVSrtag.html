<H1>modules... rtag [ falnRQq] [ b] [ d] [ r tag | -D date] symbolic_tag</H1>Requires:	repository.<P>
Changes:	repository.<P>
Synonym:	rfreeze<P>
You can use this command to assign symbolic tags to particular, explicitly
specified source versions in the repository. 'cvs rtag' works directly
on the repository contents (and requires no prior checkout). Use 'cvs
tag' instead, to base the selection of versions to tag on the contents
of your working directory.<P>
In general, tags (often the symbolic names of software distributions)
should not be removed, but the -d option is available as a means to
remove completely obsolete symbolic names if necessary (as might be
the case for an Alpha release, say).<P>
The -b option makes the tag a "branch" tag, allowing concurrent, isolated
development. This is most useful for creating a patch to a previously
released software distribution.<P>
You can use the standard -r and -D options to tag only those files
that already contain a certain tag. This method would be used to rename
a tag: tag only the files identified by the old tag, then delete the
old tag, leaving the new tag on exactly the same files as the old
tag.<P>
rtag executes recursively by default, tagging all subdirectories of
modules you specify in the argument. You can restrict its operation
to toplevel directories with the standard -l option; or you can explicitly
request recursion with -R.<P>
The modules database can specify a program to execute whenever a tag
is specified; a typical use is to send electronic mail to a group
of interested parties. If you want to bypass that program, use the
standard -n option.<P>
The standard options -Q and -q are also available with this command.<P>
Use the -a option to have rtag look in the 'Attic' for removed files
that contain the specified tag. The tag is removed from these files,
which makes it convenient to reuse a symbolic tag as development continues
(and files get removed from the upcoming distribution).
