<H1>tag [ lQqR] [ b] [ d] symbolic_tag [files...]</H1>Requires:	working directory, repository<P>
Changes:	repository.<P>
Synonym:	freeze<P>
Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest repository
versions to your working sources. The tags are applied immediately
to the repository, as with rtag, but the versions are supplied implicitly
by the cvs records of your working files' history rather than applied
explicitly.<P>
One use for tags is to record a "snapshot" of the current sources
when the software freeze date of a project arrives. As bugs are fixed
after the freeze date, only those changed sources that are to be part
of the release need be retagged.<P>
The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which revisions
of which files were used in creating a software distribution. The
checkout and update commands allow you to extract an exact copy of
a tagged release at any time in the future, regardless of whether
files have been changed, added, or removed since the release was tagged.<P>
If you use 'cvs tag -d symbolic_tag...', the symbolic tag you specify
is deleted instead of being added.<P>
Warning:	Be very certain of your ground before you delete a tag; doing
this effectively discards some historical information, which may later
turn out to have been valuable.<P>
The -b option makes the tag a "branch" tag, allowing concurrent, isolated
development. This is most useful for creating a patch to a previously
released software distribution.<P>
Normally, tag executes recursively through subdirectories; you can
prevent this by using the standard -l option, or specify the recursion
explicitly by using R.
