Use this command to declare that you wish to remove files from the
source repository. Like most cvs commands, 'cvs remove' works on files
in your working directory, not directly on the repository. As a safeguard,
it also requires that you first erase the specified files from your
working directory.<P>
The files are not actually removed until you apply your changes to
the repository with commit; at that point, the corresponding RCS files
in the source repository are moved into the 'Attic' directory (also
within the source repository).<P>
This command is recursive by default, scheduling all physically removed
files that it finds for removal by the next commit. Use the -l option
to avoid this recursion, or just specify that actual files that you
wish remove to consider.
