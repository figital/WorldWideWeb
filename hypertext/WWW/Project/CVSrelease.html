<H1>release [ dQq] modules...</H1>Requires:	Working directory<P>
Changes:	Working directory, history log<P>
This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of 'cvs checkout'.<P>
Since cvs doesn't lock files, it isn't strictly necessary to use this
command. You can always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you
leave no trace in the cvs history file that you've abandoned your
checkout.<P>
Use 'cvs release' to avoid these problems. This command checks that
no uncommitted changes are present; that you are executing it from
immediately above, or inside, a cvs working directory; and that the
repository recorded for your files is the same as the repository defined
in the module database.<P>
If all these conditions are true, 'cvs release' leaves a record of
its execution (attesting to your intentionally abandoning your checkout)
in the cvs history log.<P>
You can use the -d flag to request that your working copies of the
source files be deleted if the release succeeds.
