<H1>C++</H1>Notes by Tim on C++. See also: <A NAME=0 HREF=news:4514@cernvax.cern.ch>Werner Jank's report on Saber C</A>.<P>
C++ compiler is generally called CC (not cc)
<H2>The same as C or objective-C:</H2>Comments are C or objective-C style.<P>
Include file name conventions are the same as C (no #import)
<H2>Overload functions</H2>
<XMP>	overload pow;	// Tells compiler that overloading is not an error
	int pow(int, int)

</XMP>To overload an operator "+" for example, define a function called
"operator +"
<XMP>

</XMP>
<H2>Class specification:</H2>To declare a class:
<XMP>	class myclass {
		int	myvariable1;
		int	myvariable2;
	public:
		void myoperation(char *)
		void mymethod(int, int);
	};

</XMP>To declare a subclass (why "public"?):
<XMP>	class myclass : public superclass {
	...
	};


</XMP>To declare an instance of class myclass:
<XMP>	myclass myobject;

</XMP>To call a method on a class:
<XMP>
	myobject.mymethod(x,y);

</XMP>To define a method for a class:
<XMP>	void myclass::mymethod(int a, int b)
	{
		myvariable1 = myvariable2;		// Instance variables
		this->myvariable1 = this->myvariable2;	// Equivalent
		superclass::othermethod(2);		// cf [super ...]
		return *this;				// Really? see p25
	}
</XMP>Within the definition,  "this" is equivalent to objective-C''s "self".
I can't understand whether it is a pointer to the object or the object
itself from the above example.<P>
Note you have, in a class method, no access to the superclass's private
variables!  However, you can DECLARE that your private class variables
will be visible to SPECIFIC  methods which are "friends"
<XMP>		friend  otherclass othermethod(int, int);

</XMP>If you want to declare a method which is not defined in your (dummy)
class, but MUST be declared in any subclass, declare it "virtual".
<H2>Constructors</H2>A consructor is a method which initialises an instance.  A constructor
has the same name as its class. Several can exist with different arguments,
or no arguments.
<XMP>
	class myclass {
		int	myvariable1;
		int	myvariable2;
	public:
		myclass(char *)
		myclass(int, int);
	};

</XMP>A constructor can be called in a declaration staement:-
<XMP>		int x;
		myclass myobject(1,2)
	
</XMP>A constructor method for a subclass must give the parameters for the
constructor method for the superclass after ":".
<XMP>
	myclass::myclass(int a, int b) : (a+b)
	{
		/* code here could be void */
	}
</XMP>is the equivalent of Objective-C:
<XMP>	- newFoo: (int)a bar:(int)b
	{
		self = [super newSum:a+b]; 
		/* code here could be void */
		return self;
	}
</XMP>It seems that objective-C can only distinguish different methods by
name, not by type of parameter, whilst C++ can distinguish by either,
except that the name of a constructor is limited to the name of the
class, so constructors can ONLY be distinguished by the parameter
typing.
<H2>Inline expansion</H2>
<XMP>
</XMP>The keyword "inline" forces inline expansion of very small functions.
<H2>References</H2>The prefix "&" means "reference" rather like Algol68 "ref".
<XMP>			int &r=i;
</XMP>means r refers to i, so r++ has the effect i++. Allows values to be
passed by reference? Other uses?
<H2>Stream.h</H2>cout and cin are standard input and output streams. They take input
and output operators.
