<H1></H1>Synopsis<P>
rcsdiff [ -biwt ] [ -cefhn ] [ -q ] [ -rrev1 ] [ -rrev2 ] file ...<P>
Description<P>
Rcsdiff runs diff(1) to compare two revisions of each RCS file given.
A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name, otherwise a working
file name. Rcsdiff derives the working file name from the RCS file
name and vice versa, as explained in co(1L). Pairs consisting of both
an RCS and a working file name may also be specified.<P>
The options -b, -i, -w, -t, -c, -e, -f, and -h, have the same effect
as described in diff(1); option -n generates an edit script of the
format used by RCS. The option -q suppresses diagnostic output.<P>
If both rev1 and rev2 are omitted, rcsdiff compares the latest revision
on the default branch (normally the highest branch on the trunk) with
the contents of the corresponding working file. This is useful for
determining what you changed since the last checkin.<P>
If rev1 is given, but rev2 is omitted, rcsdiff compares revision rev1
of the RCS file with the contents of the corresponding working file.<P>
If both rev1 and rev2 are given, rcsdiff compares revisions rev1 and
rev2 of the RCS file.<P>
Both rev1 and rev2 may be given numerically or symbolically, and may
actually be attached to any of the options.<P>
Examples<P>
The command   rcsdiff f.c<P>
runs diff on the latest revision on the default branch of RCS file
f.c,v and the working file f.c.<P>
Diagnostics<P>
The exit status is 0 if there were no differences during the last
comparison, 1 if there were differences, and 2 if there were errors.<P>
Identification<P>
