<H1>export [ flNnQq] -r rev| D date [ d dir] module...</H1>Requires:	repository.<P>
Changes:	current directory<P>
This command is a variant of 'cvs checkout'; use it when you want
a copy of the source for module without the cvs administrative directories.
For example, you might use 'cvs export' to prepare source for shipment
off site. This command requires that you specify a date or tag (with
-D or -r), so that you can count on reproducing the source you ship
to others.<P>
The only non standard options are ' d dir' (write the source into
directory dir) and ' N' (don't shorten module paths). These have
the same meanings as the same options in 'cvs checkout'.<P>
The -kv option is always set when export is used. This causes any
RCS keywords to be expanded such that an import done at some other
site will not lose the keyword revision information. There is no way
to override this.
