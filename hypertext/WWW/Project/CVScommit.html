<H1>[files ...] commit [ lnR] [ m 'log_message' | -f file] [ r revision]</H1>Requires:	working directory, repository<P>
Changes:	repository.<P>
Synonym:	ci<P>
Use 'cvs commit' when you want to incorporate changes from your working
source files into the general source repository.<P>
If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of the files
in your working current directory are examined. commit is careful
to change in the repository only those files that you have really
changed. By default (or if you explicitly specify the -R option),
files in subdirectories are also examined and committed if they have
changed; you can use the -l option to limit commit to the current
directory only.<P>
commit verifies that the selected files are up to date with the current
revisions in the source repository; it will notify you, and exit without
committing, if any of the specified files must be made current first
with 'cvs update'. commit does not call the update command for you,
but rather leaves that for you to do when the time is right.<P>
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log
message that will be written to one or more logging programs and placed
in the RCS source repository file. You can instead specify the log
message on the command line with the -m option, thus suppressing the
editor invocation, or use the -f option to specify that the argument
file contains the log message.<P>
The -r option can be used to commit to a particular symbolic or numeric
revision within the RCS file. For  example, to bring all your files
up to the RCS revision "3.0" (including those that haven't changed),
you might do:<P>
cvs commit -r3.0<P>
cvs will only allow you to commit to a revision that is on the main
trunk (a revision with a single dot). However, you can also commit
to a branch revision (one that has an even number of dots) with the
-r option. To create a branch revision, one typically uses the -b
option of the rtag or tag commands. Then, either checkout or update
can be used to base your sources on the newly created branch. From
that point on, all commit changes made within these working sources
will be automatically added to a branch revision, thereby not perturbing
mainline development in any way. For example, if you had to create
a patch to the 1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version
is already under development, you might do:<P>
cvs rtag -b -rFCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module<P>
cvs checkout -rFCS1_2_Patch product_module<P>
cd product_module<P>
[[ hack away ]]<P>
cvs commit<P>
Say you have been working on some extremely experimental software,
based on whatever revision you happened to checkout last week. If
others in your group would like to work on this software with you,
but without disturbing mainline development, you could commit your
change to a new branch. Others can then checkout your experimental
stuff and utilize the full benefit of cvs conflict resolution. The
scenario might look like:<P>
cvs tag -b EXPR<P>
cvs update -rEXPR1<P>
[[ hack away ]]<P>
cvs commit<P>
Others would simply do 'cvs checkout -rEXPR1whatever_module' to work
with you on the experimental change.
