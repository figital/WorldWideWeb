<PLAINTEXT>
STRAY
In your green field sleep
Chasing through the trees
Do you still see me?
Do you still hear me?

Do you still meet me?


NOTHING NATURAL
Before I met you I was blind
Pills and liquid filled my mind
Beneath your outline I was new
Overflowing with your tune

And don't you know you're beautiful

Next month I missed you like a child
Couldn't see past you though I tried

And don't you know you're beautiful

Now I think of every hour
When you still retained your power
And the precious nights we'd share
When we'd breathe in common air

The feeling now you're gone
This wretched life goes on
The knife inside of me
It turns just like a key

The sunlight always comes too soon
My body asks me what to do
I was so small and vulnerable
And you were only beautiful

The seasons shining in your hair
And it was more than I could bear
But I can see you in my smile
And you are only beautiful


TINY SMILES
I'd like to do
Something for you
You want me to
She's just the same
She likes to play

I'll hide kisses in your hair

Don't feel ashamed
You're not to blame
It's just a game
But just the same
What would they say

Baby angel on my knee

Our lips are sealed

Come sit with me
Slide on my knee
Sing just for me
And for a while
I'll make you smile

Baby angel on my knee
I know what you want from me

I'll make you smile

Outside she's listening
To laughter and whispering
But she won't say nothing to him,
see

She's just the same


COVERT
I'm hiding inside me
Eye sees through my smile
As I shine
For the eyes of another

Let him incribe
What he admires
Let him inspire
So many lies
I can provide
Any disguise

Night folds me beside you
I hide from your eyes
For I know
This illusion is kinder
Than what you'll find
Inside
If I reveal
My crime

My deception
My invention
My obsession

You may despise
What you may find
Hiding behind
All of the lies
Let me provide
One more disguise

You won't understand me
I can't let you try
Still I dream
Of the day you discover

I am the spy


OCEAN
Come with me
Into a cool blue stream
Bleed into oceans green
Lips open wide
Drinking the tide

Reach for me
Here where the ocean sea
Melts and you sink with me
Deeper inside
I'll make you mine

Take me down
Down where their voices drown
Down where the only sound
Echoes for me

Floating away
Under the waves
Kiss me again
You'll tell me when
Salt on my lips
Cool fingertips
Under the sea
Stay here with me


FOR LOVE
Pretty little girl, she shines
Knowing she is young, she smiles
Happy just to be a prize
Happy just to see his smile

Silly little girl, she tries
Thinking she is good, and wise
Doesn't recognize the lies
Pouring from her lips, she sighs;

"This is so real,
It's what I feel,
I look in your eyes and lose myself"

Silly little girl denies
Ever understanding why
Her face is full of sad surprise
Every time she hears him cry;

"What do you feel
When you're with me?
I look in your eyes and see myself"

But there's no connection,
Just his own reflection
Isn't this the way you wanted me?
     (what do you mean?)
In love with you
     (what do I feel?)
Do anything
     (what do you mean?)
for you.

She looked in his eyes to lose herself

And when it falls apart, she cries
Doesn't think to look inside
She just covers up her eyes
Doesn't see her own disguise
And though she feels this sorrow,
It will fade tomorrow
She'll pretend that this was really love
     (what do you mean?)
she'll make their fall
     (what did I feel?)
seem beautiful
     (what do you mean?)
She won't remember this at all
     (what do you mean?)
She won't recall
     (what did I feel?)
The truth at all
     (what do you mean?)
she wants to fall
     (what did I feel?)
again
     (what do you mean?)


SUPERBLAST!
Me in the world
Losing tears, shedding
Strain for the sun
Make you run, make you come

You don't know
You don't know

I'm in my home
All the time, on my own
Low finger fine,
Take what's mine, from behind

You don't know
You don't know
It's not there
You don't care

You're still inside of me
Beneath the cotton core
My pictures smile at me
And soon they'll rise and soar

Fill up my space
Turn around, fad and trace
Be absolute,
Blue and white, fatal fruit

She nylon smile
Full of lies, shining eyes
Cover my grin
Take a chance, maybe win

It's not there
It's not fair
You don't know
You don't care


UNTOGETHER
It's not easy
But try to picture this; do
You remember
That we were once together
Isn't it strange
Isn't it?
I'm sorry it's come to this but
Why are we here,
Bothering?
What was it we talked about? So

Just remind me
Of why I'm wasting so much
Time pretinding
That ther is somethin more than
Only this
Only
This pointless accusation
Tell me again,
Why are we here?

I'm not offended by the
Things that you say
'Cause it's such a predictable
Way to behave
Taly and insult me 'til you're
Blue in the face
You were right, I was wrong, now does
That make you happy?
I'm quite aware of all the
Bad things I did
You don't have to remind me of
Why you dislike me
There's no solution to the
Mess that we're in,
It's so sad and so boring
I wish you'd just leave me alone

But I understand the games you play
I'm ashamed of all the things I did to you


FANTASY
When I'm home I listen hoping for a clue
And you know they can't tell us what to do
When you're gone, out of sight not out of mind
But you know this feeling took me years to find

And your eyes, they always know where it hurts
And your lips kiss me 'til I'm fit to burst
Each day you watch me with your static gaze
And smile, naked at my silly ways

Planets spin around your head
Milk and sugar in my bed
Even when you're far away
I can hear you every day

Wise hands grasping the delicate prize
I just wait for the time of our lives

No one knows what's going on
Thy don't know where we belong
Let you swim around my face
Live inside my special place

It's only you that the key
Don't know what you do to me
In our little secret world
I can be your little girl

My desires can't be bought in black and white
Only you make me feel secure inside
For I know you really love no one but me
And I smile because they think its fantasy


TAKE
He's perfect
At least within his dreams
He's perfect
To satisfy my scheme

He doesn't know my game
I don't recall his name

And though it's true
My flesh is new
Believe me dear
My mind is clear

He's smiling
     (smiling at me)
He thinks he's won the night
I'm laugh
     (laughing at him)
Imagine what you like

I know he's seen
Inside I'm green
But still he's blind
To what goes on inside my mind

He's smiling
     (smiling at me)
He thinks he's won the night
I'm thinking
     (thinking of me)
Imagine what you like

He claimed his prize
I had my price
I know it's cruel
But I refuse
To be the only one to lose


LAURA
Mirror maid, tummy ache
Make-up run
Lipstick girl, black stick curl
In the New York sun

Inside out, you know about my
Silly game,
Even though, you don't know
About my name

Where I've been
What I dream
What I seem

Clumsy eyes realise how to
Write the word
Basically, you sing for me
When I am hurt

Stoned and blind, never mind
Luckie's song
Press the keys, I can be
Where you belong

I'm a fan
Of your hand
Ooh

And
I'm in love
Cry above
Ooh

And
I'm a fan
Of your hand
Every man
Ooh


MONOCHROME
Wake with the sun,
What's going on, when you're gone
Fall asleep when you're near,
What's going on, when you're here

And sometimes I think if I stand by the 'phone it may ring,
And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring
And you sing, and you sing

Breathe with your sigh,
Makes me high, don't know why
Touching your skin,
Wishing you were within

Your eyes in a saucer but mine are just clouded in grey,
I've so much to tell but I can't and you just go away
Anyway, won't you stay

Wake with the sun,
What's going on when you're gone
And when I lost control,
I was cold, and I felt old

The ground is beneath me but slowly it's falling away,
You say we're like children so why won't you come out to 
play,
And sometimes I think if I look at the 'phone it may ring
And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring
When you sing, when you sing
