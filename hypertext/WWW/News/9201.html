<H1>What's new in '92</H1>Here's the latest (that we know) about W3. The High-Energy Physics
world got its first official announcement of W3 in the CERN <A NAME=5 HREF=http://crnvmc/FIND?:cnl+204>computer
newsletter</A> released at Christmas, with an introductory article. However,
there are already many users of W3 outside HEP!
<H2>New browser</H2>The new year starts with a release (version 1.1 - our first official
"version1" release) of the line mode browser.  This has protocol code
in for a wealth of new information, with:
<UL>
<LI>Direct access to internet news groups
<LI>Direct access to "<A NAME=6 HREF=http://info.cern.ch./hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/default.html#gopher> gopher</A> " campus-wide information systems etc. (Gopher
is system similar to W3 but using a web of menus and plain text files
rather than hypertext.  It is all readable as hypertext using W3)
<LI>Browsing of remote directories using FTP. Before, files could be read
- now you can browse around as well! Any FTP site becomes a W3 information
source.
<LI>Follow links directly to telnet (and rlogin) sites.  This allows hypertexts
to point to online communications facilities which don't have servers.
<LI>Extensibility using gateways - you can configure www to use specific
gateways for any access protocol which might turn up in the future
which it can't handle directly.
</UL>The user interface is slightly improved,  and  you can save a document
to a file or pipe, or print it (under unix).<P>
The browser version can be picked up by anonymous FTP in the <A NAME=2 HREF=//nxoc01/usr/local/lib/WWW/Installation.html>usual
way</A> including source binaries for  several platforms.<P>
Those who have built other hypertext systems (such as Hyperbole and
Viola) on top of the www browser will immediately gain access to the
all this newly accessible information.
<H2>W3 at SLAC</H2>Hot on the heels of the announcement of the W3 server for the "SPIRES"
High-Energy Physics <A NAME=1 HREF=//nxoc01/usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html#spires>preprint database</A> at the Stanford Linear ACcelerator
lab comes news from Paul Kunz that the line mode browser is installed
on all unix systems at SLAC. Happy browsing, folks.
<H2>Browsing on VM/CMS</H2>The IBM mainframe at CERN now has a copy of the w3 browser (v0.14)
running in line mode. We are considering ways to make it more full-screen
in the VM style.
<H2>Browsing under X with viola</H2>A version of www running in the "Viola" hypertext system looks good
- I just saw it running on an apollo and on a decstation. We hope
to release it soon with the coming new version of viola.
<H2>Conferences</H2>The W3 demonstration had an enthusiastic reception at "<A NAME=3 HREF=../../Conferences/HT91/Overview.html> HyperText'91</A>
" in San Antonio, Texas.  <P>
As I write Jean-Francois is presenting it live at the Software Engineering
and AI for High-Energy Physics workshop in La Londe, France.  We've
also been asked to demonstrate, as well as present a paper, at the
Joint European Networking Conference (JENC3) in Innsbruck, Austria,
in May. _________________________________________________________________<P>
