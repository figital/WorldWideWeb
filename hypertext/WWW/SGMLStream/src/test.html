<H1>Recommended HTML Usage</H1>

These constructs should work even on pretty broken implementations.

<H2>Text Elements</H2>

Most text elements consist of a start tag, some content,
<!-- comment foo -->
and an end tag. A start tag is an identifier surrouded by angle
<? processing instruction >
brackets. An end tag is an open angle bracket, a slash, an
identifier, and a close bracket.  <P>

An identifier should be a letter followed by up to 7 letters
or numbers.  <P>

No spaces are allowed between the tag open bracket
and the identifier. Space is allowed between the identifier
and the close bracket.  <P>

Some elements are "empty" and consist of only a start tag.  <P>

Paragraphs are separated by the "P" element.  <P>

Six levels of headings are supported:  <P>

<H3>Level three heading</H3>
<H4>Level four heading</H4>
<H5>five</H5>
<H6>six</H6>

Unordered lists:  <P>

<UL>
<LI> This is the first item of an unordered list.
<LI> This is the second item. It's kinda long, and should wrap around
on most screens.  <P>
<LI> This is the third item. It's only one paragraph, but it's got
a paragraph tag at the end.<P>
<LI> This is the fourth and final item.
</UL>

Ordered lists:  <P>

<oL>
<LI> This is the first item of an unordered list.
<LI> This is the second item. It's kinda long, and should wrap around
on most screens.
<LI> This is the third item -- you know, the one with the P element.  <P>
<LI> This is the fourth and final item.
</oL>

<DL>
<DT> term
<DD> definition
<DT> another term
<dd> and its definition
</DL>

The address element indicates the author or source of the document.

<H2>Normal Text: PCDATA</H2>

Normal text is represented in HTML as parsed character data, #PCDATA.
The characters '&lt;', '&gt;', and '&amp;' should be represented as
"&amp;lt;", "&amp;gt;", and "&amp;amp;" respectively, lest they
be interpreted as markup. Lines should not
exceed 72 characters. Line breaks have no significance except to
separate words.  <P>

<H2>Literal Text: RCDATA</H2>

Sections of literal text are represented in HTML as replaceable
character data. Line breaks are significant, and characters are
rendered in a fixed-width font to preserve horizontal formatting.  <P>

<XMP>
This is literal text. THIS word
should line up under  THIS word.

There should be exactly three blank lines between here



and here.

</XMP>

The '&amp;' character should be represented as "&amp;amp;".
The character sequence "&lt;/" must be represented as "&amp;lt;/".
The character sequence "]]&gt;" must represented as "]]&amp;gt;".

<XMP>
SGML tags look like <start> and &lt;/end>.
The marked section close delimiter looks like ]]&gt;.
But ]] is just two close square brackets, and
> is just a greater-than sign.
</XMP>

<H2>Document Description Elements</H2>

The TITLE element names the document.
The content of the TITLE element is just character data, CDATA.
It should be less than 72 characters, and it should contain
no linebreaks, '&lt;', '&gt;', or '&amp;' characters.  <P>

The ISINDEX tag appears at most one time, and it precedes all tags
but TITLE and NEXTID.<P>

<H2>Elements with Attributes</H2>

Some elements have associated named attributes. The values of
the attributes of an element are specified in its start tag.<P>


Attribute values are represented as RCDATA surrounded by double
quotes.  The character '"' must be represented as "&amp;quot;" in an
attribute value literal.

The NEXTID tag appears at most one time, after the title and before
the text elements.<P>
