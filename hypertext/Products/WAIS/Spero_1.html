<H1>On the commercial viability of WAIS.</H1>
<XMP>	   A response to Jane Smith's article `WAIS is a worthless fad'
	   and a proposal to for the commercial development of Wide Area
		       Information Services.

		    Simon E Spero, 10/10/1991


   In the aforementioned article, Jane discusses the various problems that
 WAIS (Wide Area Information Services) may experience in gaining acceptance 
at existing sites. In this response, I will attempt to address some of the
points she raises, and propose some possible to solutions to the problems
therin.


Existing networked sites
------------------------

  Her first claim is that policy decisons on the provision of network services
is the province of systems administrators. This is almost never the case- 
network policy is normally determined by upper management. Technical 
considerations will usually be taken into account, but in the end, services
are user driven. If management dictates that a service be provided, then
that service will be provided.

  Jane does however make the important point about critical mass - many 
sites will only install a service once it has been accepted by many other
sites. This is true, but is unimportant when change becomes user driven.

Commercialising WAIS
--------------------

  The most important point that Jane raises is the ingrained resistance that
the corporate and naive user world has to unsupported products. No matter how
much acceptance applications like 'usenet' and the Gnu suite have gained, their
market penetration is absolutely neglible when compared to programs such as
`Lotus 123', or even `Pagemaker'. It is my belief that WAIS has the potential
to be the next killer application.

  For most people, DTP is essentially useless, yet it managed to become a
 staple product, to be found on the hard disk of every personal computing 
system. DTP aspired to revolutionise the way that information was presented-
it's main result has been an increase in height of the stacks of paper on
one's desk, with no change in the actual content. Making sense of this data,
and getting it into a form where it can be useful will be one of WAISs main
selling points.

I believe that the market for WAIS products can be split into several 
categories:

	Large scale information providers.
	Medium scale information providers.
	In-house corporate information providers.
	Small scale information providers.
	End users.

Very Large scale information providers, such as Dow Jones are already addressed
by the CMDRS product from Thinking Machines Corp. [2,3,4]. However, this system
runs on the Connection Machine supercomputer, a machine costing millions of
dollars. This very high startup cost requires a lot of justification before
a purchase can be made, and only makes sense when the amount of information
to be managed is beyond a certain level.  CMDRS, and the leading edge 
hardware it represents, will remain the province of the dedicated information
provider until either hardware prices fall (CM Classic?), or sheer volume 
of data overwhelms all other options.

  The experiment at KPMG Peat Marwick [1] has demonstrated the need for 
better access to corporate information. It also showed how a corporate
wide WAIS system could be used to address this need. However, the hardware
used for this experiment was provided on loan from Thinking Machines Corp.,
avoiding the need for Peat Marwick to pre-evaluate cost issues. It is possible
that the volume of information generated in a large, paper intensive company
such as Peat Marwick would mandate the use of CMDRS, but the vast 
majority of smaller corporations would probably not reach the volume 
needed to justify the outlay.

  The only alternative server available is that included in the freely
redistributable release from TMC [5]. This software is in the public 
domain, and includes both server and client software. However, this sofware
is unsupported, and much of it is not of a commercial standard. Changes made
by the author to the base  release [6,7] have yielded performance improvements
of between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. However, query performance is still 
not yet good enough to cope with a high volume of transactions on very large
databases.

 Apart from the Unix client  xwais,  clients have been prepared for 
Macintoshes, PCs, and for dumb terminals connected to UNIX machines. There
has also been a port of the basic package to VMS.

  All of these clients are freely redistributable, and unsupported. Although
functionality is somewhat limited, all seem to be fairly reliable

  The Internet is not the only network in the world. Indeed, as ISDN becomes
more widespread, its importance outside the research community will dissapear.
Now that cheap ISDN 'modems' have become appearing (Dataflex supply a portable
modem for under GBP600), and with the approach of near 100% ISDN coverage in
many countries, network applications whose bandwidth requirements were once
prohibitive are now possible. A plug and play WAIS package could be ISDNs
killer application.

  Despite the promise that WAIS offers, the whole enterprise will stand or
fall on the quality of the information it provides.  Here WAIS already has 
a head start, due to the quality and popularity of DowQuest. The fact that
WAIS technology is not entirely an unknow factor will help encourage 
information providers to start offering WAIS oriented services.

 WAIS can be used at many levels of technology. Because it uses Open Protocols,
and is not tied to any one form of communications, products can be developed 
for currently avaiable technology ( PSTN lines, 9600/19200baud modems), 
and then leveraged on to newer technologies as they become avaialable.


A proposal
----------

 For WAIS to take off, fully supported, high-performance servers for 
conventional architectures must become available, and clients must be made 
accesible to the techically naive user. My proposal is for the formation of
a new company to market, develop, and service wide area information systems.

  In order to succeed, such a company would need to work closely with the 
original with the orignal WAIS developers - Thinking Machines Corp., KPMG
Peat Marwick, Dow Jones, and Apple. Of these, the first two are the more 
important- TMC both for the quality of its technical staff and its existing
WAIS products, PM for its marketing ability and knowledge of the needs of its
clients.

  The danger of WAIS is that there are so many dazzling new frontiers that
development may get sidetracked into areas that are not immediately profitable.
Because of this, the first product of the new company would be a package  
addressed to the corporate information user described above. 

  Such a package would comprise of a server running on a dedicated high 
performance serial machine, of the Sparcserver (4/490 or 4/690) class,
together with clients for the Macintosh and IBM-PC.  The desired capacity of
the server is a matter for conjecture- as an absolute minimum, it should be
able to handle common relevance feedback queries on databases of 1/2Gb, 
although I belive it should be possible to far exceed this by radically 
restructuring the information retrieval process.  Ideally, the first version
would be pre-sold, possibly to Peat Marwick, or a client thereof.

  The profits from such a relatively simple package could then be used to
pay for the development of the next generation of wais products.

  
Comments?
---------

  Do you think there's a need for such a company? Do you think that by 
following a plan like the one outlined above, it would be successful?
