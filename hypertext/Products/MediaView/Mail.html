MediaView is a multimedia digital publication system.  Published
works on  MediaView are cited in its online Help facility.  MediaView
is not public domain, rather  the Regents of the University of
California (UC manages LANL) retain ownership.   While there's no
charge for MediaView, users are enjoined from profiting from its use.

Custom components make MediaView indefinitely extensible.  The source
for 2 of  them is currently on the archive, as well as a document
which describes their API.

There are also 10 MediaView demo documents available. In most cases,
a figure appearing in a document is actually a button.  When in
doubt, click anything in sight.

I'll be gradually adding to this collection and I encourage others to
do the same.  I hope MediaView and its products will become a model
for sharing of creations. This includes not only documents, but
custom components as well.
