At last I get to send this, some time after our phone call.  Please
send us, for "Guidance" (assuming this to be a superset of Guide)
<UL>
<LI>Price and ordering information for a single evaluation copy, and any
indication of larger volume arrangements;
<LI>As full documentation as possible; 
<LI>Details of your HML format, so that we can consider compatibility
with our own SGML browsers;
<LI>Details of scripts which can be attached to links, so that we can
investigate the possibility of interfacing to our own information
access tools.
</UL>We have someone who is currently evaluating hypertext products, and
so we expect to order an evaluation copy immediately.<P>
Thanks in advance<P>
