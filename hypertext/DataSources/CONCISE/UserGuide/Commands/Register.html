The commands discussed in this section are not yet available on
CONCISE. They will be available in the next release.

</XMP>You may wish to be told when there is new information, or when something
is updated. To do this, go to the place of interest and use the `register'
command. There are two forms of this command: `register update' and
`register new'. The first is used to tell you when a particular item
of information has been updated. The second is used to tell you when
any new information is added beneath a particular category. For example,
to be told when the information on the NISS information service is
updated, send the following commands:
<XMP>
			start
			goto /Services/niss
			register update

</XMP>Every time the information on the NISS information service is<P>
updated (ie changed) you will now be sent a message to tell you<P>
about it. Later you may want to stop these messages being sent to<P>
you, so send the following:
<XMP>
			start
			goto /Services/niss
			deregister update


</XMP>Then you will no longer get the messages telling you about changes.
