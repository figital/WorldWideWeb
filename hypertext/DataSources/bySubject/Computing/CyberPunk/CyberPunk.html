<H1>CyberPunk Information Services</H1>There are a number of anonymous FTP sites dotted around the world
which contain information which the average CyberPunk might find interesting.
This list is, of course, incomplete.  If there are others which you would
like to be added to the list, just EMAIL me.<P>
There are probably also TELNETable sites, but I don't have any addresses.<P>
FTP sites:
