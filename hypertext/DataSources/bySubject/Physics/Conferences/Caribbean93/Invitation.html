<H1>Invitation</H1>
We are happy to invite you to attend the
<XMP>                              FIRST SPRING SCHOOL
                                      OF
              MATHEMATICS AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS OF THE CARIBBEAN
</XMP>
to be held at Saint Francois, Grande Terre, Guadeloupe, French
West Indies from May 30 to June 13, 1993.
<P>
This is the first time that an international school gathers
mathematicians and theoretical
physicists in this part of the world. The choice of the place and the
theme of the school should
attract both young and mature scientists. Scientists from all places are
invited to apply. Because of the location of the meeting one expects that
participants will come mainly from Europe,
Northern America and Latin America. We sincerely hope that you
will be able to attend.
<P>
