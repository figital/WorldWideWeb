<Title>Caribbean'93 Accomodation</Title>
<H1>Accomodation</H1>
The hotel is actually a set of different buildings and independent
bungalows. Rooms are situated
in both places. The cost per night is 170 FF (double
occupancy) or 255 FF (single occupancy). The price of a
copious breakfast is 50 FF. There is no difference of price between
rooms in buildings or rooms in bungalows. Above rates are
special prices for the participants of the
conference.
<P>
Each room has a balcony (for rooms situated in buildings) or a
terrace (for rooms situated in
bungalows) equipped with a kitchenette (with a fridge and a stove).
A local -- small -- supermarket is
open in the hotel grounds. Independent cooking is therefore
possible. Price of a full meal
(lunch or dinner) served in the hotel is 110 FF -- this is a free
buffet. There is also a small
snack bar where one can get simple salads (for lunch only). Small
restaurants exist in Saint
Francois but one should not expect to spend less than 60 FF in a
restaurant. For those who want
to cook, there is every day a traditional fruit and vegetable
market in Saint Francois along with
a reasonable size supermarket.
<P>
Accommodation is available either with twin beds or with double
beds. People travelling alone and
selecting double occupancy will be housed together with a
colleague in a room with twin beds
(participants willing to be housed together should say so before
the beginning of the school).
People coming with accompanying members (spouses) will be
housed in a room with double beds, unless otherwise mentioned.
Note that for children less than 12 years old, the 
accommodation is free -- provided they share the room of their
parents -- and all the
meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) are also free.
