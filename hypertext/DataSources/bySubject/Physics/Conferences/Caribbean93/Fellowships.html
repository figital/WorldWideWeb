<Title>Caribbean'93 Fellowships</Title>
<H1>Fellowships</H1>
This school is partly supported by CIMPA (Centre International de
Mathematiques Pures et
Appliquees). This is a French organization which has the vocation
of helping the development of
mathematical sciences in France and in developing countries. As a
consequence we are happy to
offer fifteen fellowships. These fellowships are intended for
students, mathematicians or
theoretical physicists who are at the post doctoral level or in the
process of achieving a PhD.
<P>Candidates should be either French citizens or nationals of 
developing countries. Because of the
location of the conference, it is clear that we expect mostly
candidates from Central or South
America. We plan to distribute these fellowships as follows: five
French students and ten students
of other origin. There will be an -- approximately -- equal
number of mathematicians and
theoretical physicists.
<P>The amount of each fellowship is  5500
FF. This covers two weeks of
accommodation (double occupancy with breakfast) and the major
part of the transportation costs
(remember that the price of a round trip from the nearest South
American cities is in the 2000 FF
range).
<P>We ask interested people to send an application and ask
for at least two letters of
recommendation to be transmitted to the directors of the school.
Notice that the enclosed
information concerning registration and payment does not apply
for these students since
fellowships are totally taken care of by the school.
