<TITLE>Caribbean'93 Purpose</TITLE>
<H1>Purpose of the School</H1>The purpose of the school is to present the recent progress in non-commutative
geometry, infinite dimensional geometry and operator algebras with
applications to quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.
Lectures will start from first principles but will rapidly reach an
advanced level. Participants should be confirmed scientists or students
with a doctoral or post-doctoral level (PhD) in mathematics or theoretical
physics.
