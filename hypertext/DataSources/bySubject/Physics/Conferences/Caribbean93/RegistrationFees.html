<Title>Caribbean'93 Registration Fees</Title>
<H1>Registration Fees</H1>
We want to be able to organize this school without having to ask
for any kind of registration fees.
However, several funding institutions will not give their definitive
answer before the end of 
1992. This makes impossible any evaluation of the amount of
such fees.  Should  we receive a positive answer from funding
institutions other than those mentionned
in the next section, the registration fees will be decreased or
even totally suppressed. In the
worst case, the cost will not be higher than 1000 FF per person
and this will be collected during
the conference.
