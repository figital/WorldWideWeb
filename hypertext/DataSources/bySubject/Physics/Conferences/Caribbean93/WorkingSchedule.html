The meeting will begin on Monday, May 31 at 8.00 pm. (welcome party)
and will end on Sunday 13.  At this time of the year, sunrise occurs
before 5 am and it is very dark already at 7 pm. There is no twilight.
People use sun time and usually wake up rather early. Breakfast starts
being served in the hotel at 6 am. Because of these facts and because
the temperature can be rather high in the middle of the day, working
hours will be the following : 7.30 am - 10.45 am and 4.00 pm - 7.15 pm
(this includes a 15 minute break during the morning and evening classes).
<P>The following equipment will be available : slide
projector, overhead projector for transparencies, white board,
blackboard. Photocopies will be available at a charge.
<P>We shall have a lounge where preprints, reprints or photocopies of
talks can be displayed. Please bring some of your papers for display
if you wish.
