<Title>Caribbean'93 Registration</Title>
<H1>Registration and Payment</h1>
Interested scientists should apply AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
by sending a message
by regular mail (if possible using the enclosed
<A HREF=PreRegistration.html>pre-registration form</A>)
or e-mail to <A HREF=PreRegistration.html#Maryse>Maryse Cohen Solal</A>.
This will allow us to make
a first estimate of the number of participants and make
appropriate reservations. The number of participants is only
limited by the size of the conference room. If a selection has to be
made, it will be done on a
basis corresponding to the arrival time of registrations.
<P>However
we wish to point out that
Guadeloupe is a famous tourist centre and that we have to make
definitive  hotel reservations a long
time in advance. For this reason, the above registration will only
become effective provided we
receive a 20% deposit corresponding to the cost of your
accommodation. This deposit should be sent BEFORE THE 15th NOVEMBER 1992, this
is required by the hotel -- and if possible earlier. In
the opposite case we may not be
able to guarantee a room for you.  Full payment concerning
the accommodation has to be made
before arrival in Guadeloupe and is totally handled by
``Les Hotels Anchorage'', Direction Generale, 4 rue Sedillot,
75007 PARIS, France.
<P>All this means that registration and
payment will be a four-step process:
<UL>
<LI>1. Send mail to M. Cohen-Solal for pre-registration and specify if
you select single or double occupancy
<LI>2. Wait for approval
<LI>3. Send a money order corresponding to 20% of your
accommodation before the 15th November 1992
<LI>4. Send the complement -- 80% -- before the 30th April 1993
</UL>
We suggest that you perform step three together with or
immediately after step one.
<P>
These payments should be done IN FRENCH FRANCS and
by using personal cheques (only in
the case of cheques drawn from a French bank) or by bank
transfer.  In the latter case the
transfer should clearly indicate your name, in order to identify the
payment and in both cases should bear
the mention ``Caribbean Mathematical and Theoretical Physics,
Anse des Rochers, 30/5/93-13/6/93''.
This indication will allow you to benefit from the special hotel
rates described previously.
Payment should be made to the following accounts:
<DL>
<DT>Personal cheques
<DD>Hotels Anchorage, SIRETO S.A., 4, rue Sedillot, 75007 Paris, France
<DT>Bank transfers
<DD>Banque Neuflize Schlumberger Mallet, 3 Ave. Hoche, 75008 Paris, France,
Banking account of SIRETO S.A. RESERVATION, which is
Bank: Neuflize Paris Italie,
Code Banque: 30788, Code Guichet: 00175, Account number:
10003003404, RIB 83
</DL>
We remind you that the total cost of the
accommodation (including breakfast), for two weeks, is
220 x 14 = 3080 FF in the case of double occupancy and
305 x 14 = 4270 FF in the case
of single occupancy.
<P>
The school is scheduled to last two weeks and there are no
thematic differences between the
topics discussed during these two weeks. However, if several
people want to come for a single week,
they may choose to do so and make this known to the organizers.
<P>
The enclosed <A HREF=Invitation.html>Invitation page</A> should be
enough, in most cases, to
allow you to ask for a partial or total reimbursement from
your home institution. Personalized
invitation letters, if needed, can be obtained directly from the
organizers (please provide relevant information).
<P>
As a rule, participants should take care of their own
transportation (cf. the section entitled
<A HREF=Transportation.html>``Transportation''</A>).
However, participants intending to leave from
Paris should already mention this
clearly on their registration form. Indeed, as already
mentioned, the organizers plan to reserve ``block seats''
on a plane of Air Outre Mer leaving Paris on Sunday May 30,
1993. This would minimize the
corresponding cost. These participants will then receive further
relevant information.
