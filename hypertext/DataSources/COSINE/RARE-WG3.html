of users and providers of European research oriented networks.  RARE
Working Group 3 (WG3) was set up in order to coordinate and harmonise
the collection and provision of information of use to the member bodies
of RARE.WG3 comprises two subgroups:
<UL>
<LI>The User Support and Information Services subgroup (USIS);
<LI>The Directory Services subgroup (DS).
</UL>Members of the group are national representatives, typically one per
subgroup nominated by the national RARE contacts, and invited experts
including representatives from European-wide research networks. All
members contribute to the work of WG3 on a voluntary basis.<P>
The work of the group is closely related to that of the other RARE
Working Groups.<P>

The Working Group meets 3 to 4 times a year to discuss actual developments
and future work items related to the activities mentioned in its terms
