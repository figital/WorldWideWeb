<H1>Mailboxes</H1>Mailbox is one of the fields routined checked in a general search,
and  if your target contains an '@', it is the ONLY field tried.
Input of  "joe" would find mailboxes "joe@..." and "joe%...". <P>
Mailboxes are stored in the database with the host part canonicalized,
 that is, made official.  If you use a non-official hostname or 
nickname, it is automatically canonicalized for you before the search.
 If the named host is not known, the search is performed anyway on
the exact target string. <P>
You may search for mailboxes any of three ways: 
<DL>
<DT>user@
<DD> Looks for mailboxes with a username part of 
<DD> "user" on any
host. This is a fast search. 
<DT>@host
<DD> Finds ALL mailboxes on host "host".  This is  a SLOW search.

<DT>user@host
<DD> Looks for an exact mailbox match, user andhost parts both.
This is fastest.
