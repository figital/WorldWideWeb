<H2><A NAME=BernersLee> Tim Berners-Lee</A></H2>Currently in CN division.   Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on. among other things,  document production and text processing.   He developped his first hypertext system, "Enquire",   in 1980 for his own use (although unaware of the existence of the term HyperText). With a background  in real-time software and communications, Tim decided that CERN  needed a networked hypertext system and was an ideal site for the development of hypertext ideas.  Tim started  the <A NAME=0 HREF=../../WWW/TheProject.html>WorldWideWeb</A> project at CERN in 1990.
