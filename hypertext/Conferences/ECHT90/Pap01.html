We need better authors more than anything else now. Authors are not yet used to the medium.
Existing texts can be put into hypertext, but the construction of new material, 
produced explicitly for the hypertext medium, requires different ways of working and presenting
ideas. Only a handful of authors today have achieved significant production.

or of fraudulent information posing for the real thing.
