<h1>Glasgow Online</h1>
This was a very carefully handcrafted 16MB hypertext built
by <a href=People.html#baird>Patricia Baird</a> and around 30 others at Strathclyde.
It is a complete town guide to Glasgow, including maps, and using lots of graphics.
Uses Hypercard 1. Distributed for 25 pounds to cover the 10 or so disketes if you want one.
