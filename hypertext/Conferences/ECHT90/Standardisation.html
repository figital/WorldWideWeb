There was not a lot of discussion of this at <a href=Introduction.html>ECHT90</a>,

<li><a href=People.html#newcombe>Steve newcombe's</a> and Goldfarber's "Hytime" committee
looking into SGML, and
<li>An ISO working group known as MHEG, "Multimedia/HyperText Expert Group".
led by one Francis Kretz (Thompsa SA? Rennes?).
