<H1>HT91 paper: Outline - Draft</H1>This is an outline for a paper for possible presentation to the <A NAME=1 HREF=../Overview.html>HT91
conference</A> . See also: The <A NAME=3 HREF=Paper.html>paper itself</A> .<P>
The aim of the paper is to present the <A NAME=2 HREF=../../WWW/TheProject.html>WWW</A> as a set of solutions to
some demonstrated problems. The WWW solutions differ from most of
those presented at HT90, primarily in the following points:
<UL>
<LI>The link information is stored in or with the document, not in a central
repository.
<LI>There is a blending of index search and link jumping (ref Microcosm)
in that an index search result is normal hypertext.
<LI>There is data format negociation between client and server, to allow
continuous development of new representations.
<LI>More intelligence is vested in the server, in its ability to do searches
and format conversions, reducing network load, and allowing different
indexing schemes to be used on different machines.
