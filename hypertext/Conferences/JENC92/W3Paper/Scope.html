<H1>Scope of article</H1>This article gives a technical description of the World-Wide Web (or
w3) initiative's architecture, protocols and data formats.   The dream
of global hypertext with full text retrieval has been described in
our <A NAME=1 HREF=//dxcern/userd/tbl/hypertext/WWW/Bibliography.html#6>ENRAP paper</A>, which also discusses a little the difference betwen
W3 and some other network information retrieval systems, for which
it contains references.  An introduction to the W3 for system managers
has been given in the <A NAME=2 HREF=//dxcern/userd/tbl/hypertext/WWW/Bibliography.html#7>AIHEP paper</A>.  Here we give technical details
for those who are interested in how W3 works, and why it has been
designed in that way.
