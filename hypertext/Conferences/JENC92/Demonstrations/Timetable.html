<H1>lecture demos: timing</H1>Draft Programme for the Evening Lecture Demonstrations:<P>
 ======================================================<P>
 <P>
 Note the "duration" is MAXIMUM time of actual demo.  A safety gap
of 5<P>
 minutes between demos is allowed for swopping over and for the next<P>
 demoer to get ready.  It will be needed.  Also two 10 minute breaks<P>
 are built in to help attendees and demoers to get through the evening!<P>
 and to allow for contingencies.  It is the demonstrators<P>
 responsibility to ensure that their software is installed and working.<P>
 Every effort should be made to keep to time.  Please try to do this<P>
 and help to make this session a success.<P>
