<H1>Posters</H1>During the <A NAME=1 HREF=Programme.html>Conference</A> , a poster wall will be available for the display
of posters covering a topic of common interest to the participants.
Participants are invited to submit a poster of one or, exceptionally,
two A-4 pages, presenting their project. Posters must be handed in
at the reception not later than Monday May 11 in the evening. They
must contain a clear indication of the authors' name and affiliation.
The Programme Committee will select the two best posters, taking into
account the quality of the project, its presentation and the interest
to the networking community. The winning poster will be included in
the Conference Proceedings. One author from each of the two selected
projects will be offered free admission to next year's Conference.</A>
