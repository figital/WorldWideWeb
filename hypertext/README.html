<TITLE>Read Me</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>WorldWideWeb distributed code</H1>See the CERN <A NAME=2 HREF=Copyright.html>copyright</A> .  This is the README file which you get when
you unwrap one of our tar files. These files contain information about
hypertext, hypertext systems, and the WorldWideWeb project. If you
have taken this with a .tar file, you will have only a subset of the
files.<P>
THIS FILE IS A VERY ABRIDGED VERSION OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE
ON THE WEB.   IF IN DOUBT, READ THE WEB DIRECTLY. If you have not
got any browser installed, do this by telnet to info.cern.ch (no username
or password).
<H2>Archive Directory structure</H2>Under /pub/www, besides this README file, you'll find bin, src and
doc directories.  The main archives are as follows:
<DL>
<DT><A NAME=4>src/WWWLibrary_v.vv.tar.Z</A>
<DD> The W3  Library. All source, and Makefiles
for selected systems.
<DT>src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z
<DD> The Line mode browser - all source, and
Makefiles for selected systems. Requires the <A NAME=5 HREF=#4>Library</A> .
<DT>src/WWW/LineModeDefaults_v.vv.tar.Z
<DD> The on-line doucmnetation for
the line mode browser, which you may still want if you get the program
as binary. A subset of the full source above.
<DT>src/WWWNextStepEditor.tar.Z
<DD> The Hypertext Browser/editor for the NeXT
-- source and binary.
<DT>src/WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z
<DD> The HTTP daemon, and WWW-WAIS  gateway programs.
Source.
<DT>doc/WWWBook.tar.Z
<DD> A snapshot of our internal documentation - we prefer
you to access this on line -- see warnings below.
<DT>bin/xxx/bbbb
<DD> Executable binaries of program bbbb for system xxx. Check
what's there before you bother compiling. (Note HP is called "snake")
</DL>

<H2>Generated Directory structure</H2>The tar files are all designed to be unwrapped in the same (this)
directory. They create different parts of a common directory tree
under that directory. There may be some duplication. They also generate
a few files in this directory: README.*, Copyright.*, and some installation
instructions (.txt).
<H2>NeXTStep Browser/Editor</H2>The browser for the NeXT is those files contained in the application
directory WWW/Next/Implementation/WorldWideWeb.app and is compiled.Whe
you install the app, you may want to configure the default page, WorldWideWeb.app/default.html.
These must point to some useful information! You should keep it up
to date with pointers to info on your site and elsewhere. If you use
the CERN home page note there is a link at the bottom to the master
copy on our server. See <A NAME=6 HREF=WWW/NeXT/Installation.html>Installation instructions</A>.
<H2>Line Mode browser</H2>Binaries of this for some systems are available in /pub/www/bin/ .<P>
. If the binary exists for your system, take that and also the  /pub/www/WWWLineModeDefaults.tar.Z.
Unwrap the documentation, and put (link) its directory into /usr/local/lib/WWW
on your machine. Put the www executable into your path somewhere,
and away you go.<P>
If no binary exists, procede as follows. Take the source tar file
WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z , uncompress and untar it. You will then find
the line Mode browser in WWW/LineMode/Implementation/... (See <A NAME=1 HREF=WWW/LineMode/Defaults/Installation.html>Installation
notes</A> ).  Do the same thing (in the same directory) to the WWWLibrary_v.cc.tar.Z
file to get the common library.<P>
You will have an ASCII printable manual in the file WWW/LineMode/Defaults/line-mode-guide.txt
which you can print out at this stage. This is a frozen copy of some
of the online documentation.<P>
Subdirectories to WWW/LineMode contain Makefiles for systems to which
we have already ported.  If your system is not among them, make a
new subdirectory with the system name, and copy the Makefile from
an existing one. Change the directory names as needed. PLEASE INFORM
US OF THE CHANGES WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THE PORT. This is a condition
of your use of this code, and will save others repeating your work,
and save you repeating it in future releases.<P>
Whe you install the browsers, you should configure the default page.
This is /usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html for the line mode browser.
This must point to some useful information!  You should keep it up
to date with pointers to info on your site and elsewhere. If you use
the CERN home page note there is a link at the bottom to the master
copy on our server.<P>
Some basic documentation on the browser is delivered with the home
page in the directory WWW/LineMode/Defaults. A separate tar file of
that directory (WWWLineModeDefaults.tar.Z) is available if you just
want to update that.<P>
The rest of the documentation is in hypertext, and so wil be readable
most easily with a browser. We suggest that after installing the browser,
you browse through the basic documentation so that you are aware of
the options and customisation possibilities for example.
<H2>Viola browser for X11</H2>Viola is an X11 application for reading global hypertext.  If a binary
is  available from your machine, in /pub/www/bin/.../viola*, then
take that and also the Viola "apps" tar file which contains the scripts
you will need.<P>
To generate this from source, you will need both the W3 library and
the Viola source files.  There is an Imakefile with the viola source
directory. You will need to generate the XPA and XPM libraries and
the W3 library befere you make viola itself.
<H2>Documentation</H2>In the /pub/www/doc directory are a number articles, preprints and
guides on the web. <P>
See the online <A NAME=3 HREF=WWW/Bibliography.html>WWW bibliography</A> for a list of these and other articles,
books, etc.<P>
The archive /pub/www/doc/WWWBook.tar.Z  is an extract of the text
from the WorldWideWeb (WWW) project documentation.<P>
This is a snapshot of a changing hypertext system. The text is provided
as example hypertext only, not for general distribution. The accuracy
of any information is not guaranteed, and no responsibility will be
accepted by the authors for any loss or damage due to inaccuracy or
omission.  A copy of the documentation is inevitably out of date,
and may be inconsistent. There are links to information which is not
provided in that tar file.  If any of these facts cause a problem,
you should access the original master data over the network using
www, or mail us.
<H2>Servers</H2>The Daemon tar file contains (in this release) the code for the basic
HTTP daemon for serving files, and also for the WWW-WAIS gateway.
To compile the WAIS gateway, you will need [a link to] a WAIS distribution
at the same level as the WWW directory.
<H2>General</H2>Your comments will of course be most appreciated, on code, or information
on the web which is out of date or misleading. If you write your own
hypertext and make it available by anonymous ftp or using a server,
tell us and we'll put some pointers to it in ours. Thus spreads the
web...
